The development of Rhenium I photocatalysts has been pursued since Lehn first showed the excellent performance of the Re\textsuperscript{I} bipyridine tricarbonyl catalyst. Since then, development has modified the organic ligand to demonstrate continued or improved activity with other $\alpha$-diimine bidentate geometries. Geometry has been limited to $\kappa$\textsubscript{2} motifs, with \textit{fac}-(CO)\textsubscript{3} and axial halide. This work will demonstrate the synthesis, characterization, and testing of a new $\kappa$\textsubscript{3}(L\textsubscript{3})-Re\textsuperscript{1}-\textit{mer}-(CO)\textsubscript{2}X (X = Cl, Br, CN, OTf) family of compounds for CO\textsubscript{2} reduction, as well as computational investigations into the mechanism of the reduction,
