The development of Rhenium I photocatalysts has been pursued since Lehn first showed the excellent performance of the \ce{Re^I} bipyridine tricarbonyl catalyst. Since then, development has modified the organic ligand to demonstrate continued or improved activity with other $\alpha$-diimine bidentate geometries. Geometry has been limited to bidentate motifs, with \textit{fac}-\ce{(CO)3} and axial halides. This work will demonstrate the synthesis, characterization, and testing of a new terdentate, \ce{$\kappa$^3(L3)-Re^1(CO)2X} (X = Cl, Br, CN, OTf) family of compounds for \ce{CO2} reduction, as well as computational investigations into the mechanism of the reduction of \ce{CO2} to \ce{CO} and other species. Development of computational aides will be described as well.
