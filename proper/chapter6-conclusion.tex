The target \ce{Re^I} terdentate terpyridine compounds were successfully synthesized, characterized, and tested for photocatalytic \ce{CO2} reduction. The catalysts show no activity for the reduction, in contrast to the known excellent bipyridine compounds. 

The reaction mechanisms were studied successfully with \gls{ac.dft} methods, resulting in the proposed new geometry for the production of {CO} with no carbonate or formate anions. This new geometry does not conflict with known experimental studies, yet avoids three-body mechanistic steps.
