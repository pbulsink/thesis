	Abstract = { We describe a new strategy for enhancing the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a homogeneous catalyst, using a room-temperature ionic liquid as both the solvent and electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior of fac-ReCl(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3 in neat 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate ([emim][TCB]) was compared with that in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6]. Two separate one-electron reductions occur in acetonitrile (−1.74 and −2.11 V vs Fc+/0), with a modest catalytic current appearing at the second reduction wave under CO2. However, in [emim][TCB], a two-electron reduction wave appears at −1.66 V, resulting in a ∼0.45 V lower overpotential for catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the apparent CO2 reduction rate constant, kapp, in [emim][TCB] exceeds that in acetonitrile by over one order of magnitude (kapp = 4000 vs 100 M--1 s--1) at 25 $\pm$ 3 $\,^{\circ}$C. Supported by time-resolved infrared measurements, a mechanism is proposed in which an interaction between [emim]+ and the two-electron reduced catalyst results in rapid dissociation of chloride and a decrease in the activation energy for CO2 reduction. },

@article{agarwal2012b,
	Abstract = { The chemical conversion of CO2 has been studied by numerous experimental groups. Particularly the use of rhenium tricarbonyl-based molecular catalysts has attracted interest owing to their ability to absorb light, store redox equivalents, and convert CO2 into higher-energy products. The mechanism by which these catalysts mediate reduction, particularly to CO and HCOO--, is poorly understood, and studies aimed at elucidating the reaction pathway have likely been hindered by the large number of species present in solution. Herein the mechanism for carbon monoxide production using rhenium tricarbonyl catalysts has been investigated using density functional theory. The investigation presented proceeds from the experimental work of Meyer's group (J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.1985, 1414--1416) in DMSO and Fujita's group (J. Am. Chem. Soc.2003, 125, 11976--11987) in dry DMF. The latter work with a simplified reaction mixture, one that removes the photo-induced reduction step with a sacrificial donor, is used for validation of the proposed mechanism, which involves formation of a rhenium carboxylate dimer, [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO), where dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine. CO2 insertion into this species, and subsequent rearrangement, is proposed to yield CO and the carbonate-bridged [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO2). Structures and energies for the proposed reaction path are presented and compared to previously published experimental observations. },

@article{agarwal2011,
	Abstract = { Tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes, such as Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl, have demonstrated superior activity in catalyzing CO2 reduction in the presence of sacrificial electron donors. We have utilized density functional theory (DFT) to investigate a potential pathway for formate production via a rhenium−hydride insertion mechanism in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). On the basis of prior studies, we re-examined the role of TEA and studied a catalytic cycle for CO2 reduction in which TEA functions as both the hydrogen atom and the electron donor for reducing CO2 into formate. The catalytic cycle is found to be exothermic with inclusion of solvation and may be viewed as a two-electron reduction of CO2 because the net result is a transfer of hydride from TEA to CO2. In addition, we have identified structures of key intermediates in the CO2-reduction process and found that the insertion step has a very modest barrier in acetonitrile. These findings provide a molecular-level understanding to formate production via CO2 reduction mediated by transition-metal complexes. A theoretical investigation is underway to elucidate the formation of carbon monoxide, another common product in Re-catalyzed CO2 reduction. },

@article{machan2014,
	Abstract = { The use of infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC) as a characterization method for molecular electrocatalysts allows researchers to identify key intermediates and products during the course of an electrochemical reaction. Since such reactions are driven by the application of potential, properly designed cells allow for the examination of the stepwise formation of active species and their subsequent reactivity with substrate. These results can be compared to and independently verified by the concomitant generation of similar species by chemical means. Recently we have used such an approach to characterize the catalytically relevant species and products for the reduction of CO2 by 2,2′-bipyridyl-based ReI and MnI fac-tricarbonyl electrocatalysts. This tutorial review summarizes the requirements of IR-SEC cells and details some examples of mechanistic questions addressed in our laboratory using these methods. IR-SEC is presented as a general method that could be adapted by other laboratories to answer questions of interest in the spectroscopic characterization of the full complement of redox states of organometallic complexes and their reactivities. },

	Abstract = {Since the discovery that bis(imino)pyridine ligands are able to confer high activities in ethylene oligomerization and polymerization to their iron complexes{,} considerable attention has been focused on catalyst design for these reactions and this research constitutes an ever-growing area in molecular catalysis. The tuning of the ligand structures and properties{,} and thus of catalysts{,} generally represents the basis for subsequent work contributing to process development and industrialization. Significant effort is therefore devoted to generate structural diversity in order to access the required catalyst stability and selectivity. This feature article outlines nitrogen-containing ligands that have been developed for the iron-catalyzed oligomerization of ethylene since the seminal discovery of the properties of bis(imino)pyridine ligands.},

	Abstract = { The synthesis, characterization, and ethylene polymerization behavior of a series of iron and cobalt halide complexes, LMXn (M = Fe, X = Cl, n = 2, 3, X = Br, n = 2; M = Co, X = Cl, n = 2), bearing chelating 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl ligands L [L = 2,6-(ArNCR1)2C5H3N] is reported. X-ray diffraction studies show the geometry at the metal centers to be either distorted square pyramidal or distorted trigonal bipyramidal. Treatment of the complexes LMXn with methylaluminoxane (MAO) leads to highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts converting ethylene to highly linear polyethylene (PE). LFeX2 precatalysts with ketimine ligands (R1 = Me) are approximately an order of magnitude more active than precatalysts with aldimine ligands (R1 = H). Catalyst productivities in the range 3750−20600 g/mmol·h·bar are observed for Fe-based ketimine catalysts, while Co ketimine systems display activities of 450−1740 g/mmol·h·bar. Molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers produced are in the range 14000−611000. Changing reaction conditions also affects productivity and molecular weight; in some systems, a bimodal molecular weight distribution is observed. On the basis of evidence gathered to date, the lower molecular weight fraction is a result of chain transfer to aluminum while the higher molecular weight fraction is produced by a combination of mainly β-H transfer and some chain transfer to aluminum. },

	Abstract = { We report herein the mechanism of the photochemical ligand substitution reactions of a series of fac-[Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(PR3)]+ complexes (1) and the properties of their triplet ligand-field (3LF) excited states. The reason for the photostability of the rhenium complexes [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(py)]+ (3) and [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3Cl] (4) was also investigated. Irradiation of an acetonitrile solution of 1 selectively gave the biscarbonyl complexes cis,trans-[Re(X2bpy)(CO)2(PR3)(CH3CN)]+ (2). Isotope experiments clearly showed that the CO ligand trans to the PR3 ligand was selectively substituted. The photochemical reactions proceeded via a dissociative mechanism from the 3LF excited state. The thermodynamical data for the 3LF excited states of complexes 1 and the corrective nonradiative decay rate constants for the triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) states were obtained from temperature-dependence data for the emission lifetimes and for the quantum yields of the photochemical reactions and the emission. Comparison of 1 with [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(py)]+ (3) and [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3Cl] (4) indicated that the 3LF states of some 3- and 4-type complexes are probably accessible from the 3MLCT state even at ambient temperature, but these complexes were stable to irradiation at 365 nm. The photostability of 3 and 4, in contrast to 1, can be explained by differences in the trans effects of the PR3, py, and Cl- ligands. },

@article{morris2009,
	Abstract = { The scientific community now agrees that the rise in atmospheric CO2, the most abundant green house gas, comes from anthropogenic sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. This atmospheric rise in CO2 results in global climate change. Therefore methods for photochemically transforming CO2 into a source of fuel could offer an attractive way to decrease atmospheric concentrations. One way to accomplish this conversion is through the light-driven reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (CH4(g)) or methanol (CH3OH(l)) with electrons and protons derived from water. Existing infrastructure already supports the delivery of natural gas and liquid fuels, which makes these possible CO2 reduction products particularly appealing. This Account focuses on molecular approaches to photochemical CO2 reduction in homogeneous solution. The reduction of CO2 by one electron to form CO2*− is highly unfavorable, having a formal reduction potential of −2.14 V vs SCE. Rapid reduction requires an overpotential of up to 0.6 V, due at least in part to the kinetic restrictions imposed by the structural difference between linear CO2 and bent CO2*−. An alternative and more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer. The development of catalysts, redox mediators, or both that efficiently drive these reactions remains an important and active area of research. We divide these reactions into two class types. In Type I photocatalysis, a molecular light absorber and a transition metal catalyst work in concert. We also consider a special case of Type 1 photocatalysis, where a saturated hydrocarbon links the catalyst and the light absorber in a supramolecular compound. In Type II photocatalysis, the light absorber and the catalyst are the same molecule. In these reactions, transition-metal coordination compounds often serve as catalysts because they can absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum and can promote activation of small molecules. This Account discusses four classes of transition-metal catalysts: (A) metal tetraaza-macrocyclic compounds; (B) supramolecular complexes; (C) metalloporphyrins and related metallomacrocycles; (D) Re(CO)3(bpy)X-based compounds where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine. Carbon monoxide and formate are the primary CO2 reduction products, and we also propose bicarbonate/carbonate production. For comprehensiveness, we briefly discuss hydrogen formation, a common side reaction that occurs concurrently with CO2 reduction, though the details of that process are beyond the scope of this Account. It is our hope that drawing attention both to current mechanistic hypotheses and to the areas that are poorly understood will stimulate research that could one day provide an efficient solution to this global problem. },

	Abstract = { The donor--acceptor ligands 11-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (dppz-PhNPh2) and 11-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (dppz-PhNMe2), and their rhenium complexes, [Re(CO)3X] (X = Cl--, py, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (dmap)), are reported. Crystal structures of the two ligands were obtained. The optical properties of the ligands and complexes are dominated by intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) transitions from the amine to the dppz moieties with λabs = 463 nm (ε = 13 100 M--1 cm--1) for dppz-PhNMe2 and with λabs = 457 nm (ε = 16 900 M--1 cm--1) for dppz-PhNPh2. This assignment is supported by CAM-B3LYP TD-DFT calculations. These ligands are strongly emissive in organic solvents and, consistent with the ILCT character, show strong solvatochromic behavior. Lippert--Mataga plots of the data are linear and yield Δμ values of 22 D for dppz-PhNPh2 and 20 D for dppz-PhNMe2. The rhenium(I) complexes are less emissive, and it is possible to measure resonance Raman spectra. These data show relative band intensities that are virtually unchanged from λexc = 351 to 532 nm, consistent with a single dominant transition in the visible region. Resonance Raman excitation profiles are solvent sensitive; these data are modeled using wavepacket theory yielding reorganization energies ranging from 1800 cm--1 in toluene to 6900 cm--1 in CH3CN. The excited state electronic absorption and infrared spectroscopy reveal the presence of dark excited states with nanosecond to microsecond lifetimes that are sensitive to the ancillary ligand on the rhenium. These dark states were assigned as phenazine-based 3ILCT states by time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy shows transient features in which Δν(CO) is approximately −7 cm--1, consistent with a ligand-centered excited state. Evidence for two such states is seen in mid-infrared transient spectra. },

The photocatalytic abilities were affected by the phosphine ligands on the Re unit, and the supramolecule with P(p-Cl-C6H4)3 ligands exhibited better photocatalysis (ΦCO = 0.12, TONCO = 1138, TOFCO = 3.3 min--1). The detailed studies clarified the electron balance and material balance; i.e., one molecule of the sacrificial electron donor (1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH)) donated two electrons, one molecule of CO2 accepted the two electrons, and another CO2 molecule served as an ``O2--'' acceptor to give each molecule of the two-electron oxidized compound of BIH, CO, and HCO3--. },

	Abstract = { Excited-state properties of fac-[Re(dmb)(CO)3(CH3CN)]PF6, [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2 (where dmb = 4,4`-dimethyl-2,2`-bipyridine), and other tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes were investigated by transient FTIR and UV−vis spectroscopy in CH3CN or THF. The one-electron reduced monomer, Re(dmb)(CO)3S (S = CH3CN or THF), can be prepared either by reductive quenching of the excited states of fac-[Re(dmb)(CO)3(CH3CN)]PF6 or by homolysis of [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2. In the reduced monomer's ground state, the odd electron resides on the dmb ligand rather than on the metal center. Re(dmb)(CO)3S dimerizes slowly in THF, kd = 40 $\pm$ 5 M-1 s-1. This rate constant is much smaller than those of other organometallic radicals which are typically 109 M-1 s-1. The slower rate suggests that the equilibrium between the ligand-centered and metal-centered radicals is very unfavorable (K ≈ 10-4). The reaction of Re(dmb)(CO)3S with CO2 is slow and competes with the dimerization. Photolysis of [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2 in the presence of CO2 produces CO with a 25−50% yield based on [Re]. A CO2 bridged dimer, (CO)3(dmb)Re−CO(O)−Re(dmb)(CO)3 is identified as an intermediate. Both [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO2) and Re(dmb)(CO)3(OC(O)OH) are detected as oxidation products; however, the previously reported formato-rhenium species is not detected. },

	Abstract = { The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using rhenium(I) complexes has been investigated by means of a detailed comparison of the photocatalyses of three rhenium(I) complexes, fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3L] (L = SCN- (1-NCS), Cl- (1-Cl), and CN- (1-CN)). The corresponding one-electron-reduced species (OER) of the complexes play two important roles in the reaction:  (a) capturing CO2 after loss of the monodentate ligand (L) and (b) donation of the second electron to CO2 by another OER without loss of L. In the case of 1-NCS, the corresponding OER has both of the capabilities in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in more efficient CO formation (with a quantum yield of 0.30) than that of 1-Cl (quantum yield of 0.16), for which OER species have too short a lifetime to accumulate during the photocatalytic reaction. On the other hand, 1-CN showed no photocatalytic ability, because the corresponding OER species does not dissociate the CN- ligand. Based on this mechanistic information, the most efficient photocatalytic system was successfully developed using a mixed system with fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ and fac-[Re{4,4`-(MeO)2bpy}(CO)3{P(OEt)3}]+, for which the optimized quantum yield for CO formation was 0.59. },

	Abstract = { Photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by rhenium--bipyridyl complexes has been studied through multiple approaches during the past several decades. However, a key reaction intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex, which should govern the activity of CO2 reduction in the photocatalytic cycle, has never been detected in a direct way. In this study on photoreduction of CO2 catalyzed by the 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbpy) complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3Cl] (1), we successfully detect the solvent-coordinated Re complex [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3DMF] (2) as the light-absorbing species to drive photoreduction of CO2. The key intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3(COOH)], is also successfully detected for the first time by means of cold-spray ionization spectrometry (CSI-MS). Mass spectra for a reaction mixture with isotopically labeled 13CO2 provide clear evidence for the incorporation of CO2 into the Re--bipyridyl complex. It is revealed that the starting chloride complex 1 was rapidly transformed into the DMF-coordinated Re complex 2 through the initial cycle of photoreduction of CO2. The observed induction period in the time profile of the CSI-MS signals can well explain the subsequent formation of the CO2-coordinated intermediate from the solvent-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex. An FTIR study of the reaction mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide clearly shows the appearance of a signal at 1682 cm--1, which shifts to 1647 cm--1 for the 13CO2-labeled counterpart; this is assigned as the CO2-coordinated intermediate, ReII--COOH. Thus, a detailed understanding has now been obtained for the mechanism of the archetypical photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by a Re--bipyridyl complex. },

	Abstract = { With the goal of improving previously reported Mn bipyridine electrocatalysts in terms of increased activity and reduced overpotential, a bulky bipyridine ligand, 6,6′-dimesityl-2,2′-bipyridine (mesbpy), was utilized to eliminate dimerization in the catalytic cycle. Synthesis, electrocatalytic properties, X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, and infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC) of Mn(mesbpy)(CO)3Br and [Mn(mesbpy)(CO)3(MeCN)](OTf) are reported. Unlike previously reported Mn bipyridine catalysts, these Mn complexes exhibit a single, two-electron reduction wave under nitrogen, with no evidence of dimerization. The anionic complex, [Mn(mesbpy)(CO)3]−, is formed at 300 mV more positive potential than the corresponding state is formed in typical Mn bipyridine catalysts. IR-SEC experiments and chemical reductions with KC8 provide insights into the species leading up to the anionic state, specifically that both the singly reduced and doubly reduced Mn complexes form at the same potential. When formed, the anionic complex binds CO2 with H+, but catalytic activity does not occur until a ∼400 mV more negative potential is present. The Mn complexes show high activity and Faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction to CO with the addition of weak Br{\o}nsted acids. IR-SEC experiments under CO2/H+ indicate that reduction of a Mn(I)--CO2H catalytic intermediate may be the cause of this unusual ``over-reduction'' required to initiate catalysis. },

The α-diimines employed were the four isomeric bidiazines (bdz) 3,3`-bipyridazine, 2,2`-bipyrazine, and 2,2`- and 4,4`-bipyrimidine and the nonaromatic α-diimines 1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene (dab) and 1,3-di-tert-butylsulfurdiimine (sdi). For comparison, the complexes (L)Re(CO3)Cl, L = 2,2`-bipyridine, 1,4,7,10-tetraazaphenanthrene, and η2-2,2`,2``-terpyridine, and the new cationic species [(bdz)Re(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ were also investigated. In a further experiment, in situ EPR spectroelectrochemistry was employed to study the primary paramagnetic intermediates during the reduction of the prototype compound, (bpy)Re(CO)3Cl, under a CO2 atmosphere. The susceptibility to substitution was found to be dependent not on the redox potential but on the π molecular orbital coefficients at the metal-coordinating nitrogen centers which are reflected by 14N, 185,187Re, and 31P EPR coupling constants. The most labile systems were thus found among the complexes of the small dab and sdi ligands, despite their facile reduction. In contrast, the complexes of these nonaromatic compounds showed an electrochemically reversible one-electron oxidation which, in comparison to the absorption maximum, allowed us to estimate contributions to the reorganization energy of the MLCT excited state in two cases. For the reductive labilization, it is primarily the small but variable and EPR-detectable ligand-to-metal electron (spin) transfer at the metal/ligand interface which determines the extent of activation in 18 + δ valence electron intermediates. },

The faster the rate of this process, the higher the quantum yield of CO formation. The calculated amount of CO formation, based on the assumption that the process gives CO quantitatively, was similar to the actually observed amount under various conditions.

	Abstract = {Herein we report the reversible binding of CO2 to a very rare dearomatized PNP pincer complex (cis-[Re(PNPtBu*)(CO)2] 2). The [1{,}3]-addition of CO2 to the pincer complex is triggered by metal-ligand cooperation via an aromatization/dearomatization sequence to form cis-[Re(PNPtBu-COO)(CO)2] (3) via Re-O and C-C bond formation. The reversible binding was demonstrated by the exchange reaction of 13CO2/CO2 from the isotopically labelled compound cis-[Re(PNPtBu-13COO)(CO)2] (3a). Furthermore{,} complex 3 reacts with H2 to give free CO2 and the aromatized hydride complex cis-[Re(PNPtBu)(CO)2H] (4){,} which undergoes the reverse reaction to re-form 3 under CO2 pressure at elevated temperature. Alternatively{,} 4 reacts{,} in a low temperature pathway{,} via the insertion of CO2 into the Re-H bond to give the formate complex cis-[Re(PNPtBu)(CO)2(OOCH)] (5)]. Remarkably{,} complex 5 catalyses efficiently the dehydrogenation of formic acid under base-free conditions.},

The quadrature required for exchange correlation terms and the treatment of exact Coulomb interaction scales virtually linearly up to 100 nodes. The RI-J technique to approximate Coulomb interactions (by means of an auxiliary basis set approximation for the electron density) even shows superlinear speedup on distributed memory architectures. The bottleneck is then linear algebra. Demonstrative application examples include molecules with up to 300 atoms and 3000 basis functions that can now be treated in a few hours per geometry optimization cycle in C1 symmetry. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

	Abstract = {Alkene hydrosilylation, the addition of a silicon hydride (Si-H) across a carbon-carbon double bond, is one of the largest-scale industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis and is used in the commercial production of numerous consumer goods. For decades, precious metals, principally compounds of platinum and rhodium, have been used as catalysts for this reaction class. Despite their widespread application, limitations such as high and volatile catalyst costs and competing side reactions have persisted. Here, we report that well-characterized molecular iron coordination compounds promote the selective anti-Markovnikov addition of sterically hindered, tertiary silanes to alkenes under mild conditions. These Earth-abundant base-metal catalysts, coordinated by optimized bis(imino)pyridine ligands, show promise for industrial application.},

	Abstract = {Radiolabeled biomolecules can be used to visualize a variety of diseases through interaction with specific cell receptors. A key step is the introduction of a molecular entity that allows facile labeling with the medically useful radionuclide 99mTc without significant alteration of the structure and function of the biomolecule. One strategy focuses on the design of single amino acid chelates (SAACs){,} novel bifunctional chelators constructed from derivatized amino acids or amino acid analogues. The chelating terminus of the SAAC has been designed for effective coordination to the {99mTc(CO)3}+ core{,} while the other terminus allows incorporation into any position along a peptide sequence or into a variety of biomolecules. In applications to peptidic materials{,} the approach affords significant flexibility in the choice of donors for 99mTc coordination combined with the considerable advantages of routine solid phase synthetic techniques. The methodology allows libraries of peptide-based 99mTc(i) and 186{,}188Re(i) radiopharmaceuticals to prepared using conventional automated peptides synthesis. Other biomolecules{,} including nucleosides{,} carbohydrates{,} folic acid and vitamin B12 are also readily modified using analogous methods. The approach also allows the preparation of isostructural 99mTc and Re complexes for the correlation of in vivo and in vitro imaging studies.},

All new complexes 5-10{,} together with fac-[ReBr(CO)3(tpy)] (3) and fac-[Re(CH3CN)(CO)3(tpy)][PF6] (4){,} are characterized by solution spectroscopy; 3 and 5-9 are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The terpyridine ligands in 3 and 9 are in an unusual [small eta]2-bidentate coordination mode with a pendant pyridyl. Electrochemical studies showed successive metal-based oxidations and a ligand-centered reduction in 5-10. Significant oxidation changes are observed at the Ru(II) and Re(I) centers in 5-10 when compared with their respective monometallic components. Cubic nonlinearities of 5-10 determined by the Z-scan technique at 750 nm reveal two-photon absorption that increases significantly on progression from Ru(II) monomeric precursors to heterobimetallics{,} suggesting NLO enhancement upon heterometallic complex formation.},

Under more severe reaction conditions -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] can be converted to -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)]. In solution the tricarbonyl complexes are fluxional with the terpyridine oscillating between equivalent bidentate bonding modes. At low temperatures rotation of the unco-ordinated pyridine ring is restricted and in CDCl solution two preferred rotamers exist in approximately equal abundances. Rotational energy barriers have been estimated for the X = Cl and I complexes. The X-ray crystal structure of -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] confirms the bidentate chelate bonding of terpy with a N-Re-N angle of 74.3[degree]. The pendant pyridine ring is inclined at an angle of 52.9[degree] to the adjacent co-ordinated ring and the unco-ordinated nitrogen is directed towards the axial carbonyl and to Br.},

@article{walters2002,
	Abstract = { Stark emission spectroscopy, transient DC photoconductivity (TDCP), and ground-state dipole moment measurements have been used to evaluate charge transfer (CT) within various (X2-bipyridine)ReI(CO)3Cl complexes following 3MLCT excited-state formation. The Stark technique reports on vector differences between ground-state (μg) and excited-state (μe) dipole moments, while TDCP, when combined with independently obtained μg information, reports on scalar differences. For systems featuring collinear, same-signed ground- and excited-state dipole moments, the scalar and vector differences are equivalent. However, for the low symmetry systems studied here, they are distinctly different. The vector difference yields the effective adiabatic one-electron-transfer distance (R12), while the combined vector and scalar data yield information about dipole rotation upon ground-state/excited-state interconversion. For the systems examined, charge transfer distances are substantially smaller than geometric electron-donor/electron-acceptor site separation distances. The measured distances are significantly affected by changes in acceptor ligand substituent composition. Electron-donating substituents decrease CT distances, while electron-withdrawing substituents increase CT distances, as do aromatic substituents that are capable of expanding the bipyridyl ligand (acceptor ligand) π system. The Stark measurements additionally indicate that the CT vector and the transition dipole moment are significantly orthogonal, a consequence of strong polarization of the Re−Cl bond (orthogonal to the metal/acceptor-ligand plane) in the ground electronic state and relaxation of the polarization in the upper state. The ground-state Re−Cl bond polarization is sufficiently large that the overall ground-state scalar dipole moment exceeds the overall excited-state scalar dipole moment, despite transfer of an electron from the metal center to the diimine ligand. This finding provides an explanation for the otherwise puzzling negative solvatochromism exhibited in this family of compounds. Combining TDCP and Stark results, we find that the dipole moment can be rotated in some instances by more than 90$\,^{\circ}$ upon 3MLCT excited-state formation. The degree of rotation or reorientation can be modulated by changing the identity of the acceptor ligand substituents. Reorientational effects are smallest when the compounds feature aromatic substituents capable of spatially extending the π system of the acceptor ligand. },

	Abstract = { We report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical properties of a series of organic receptors and their corresponding ReI and RuII metal complexes as anion probes featuring bis(sulfonamide) interacting sites incorporating highly chromophoric π-conjugated quinoxaline moieties. The interactions with various anions were extensively investigated. These probe molecules are capable of recognizing F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4- with different sensitivities. The probe−anion interactions can be easily visualized via naked-eye colorimetric or luminescent responses. Probe 1 has the weakest acidic sulfonamide N−H protons and therefore simply forms hydrogen-bonding complexes with F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4-. Probe 2 undergoes a stepwise process with the addition of F- and OAc-:  formation of a hydrogen-bound complex followed by sulfonamide N−H deprotonation. Direct sulfonamide N−H deprotonation occurs upon the addition of CN-, while only a hydrogen-bound complex forms with the H2PO4- ion for probe 2 in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. Similar probe−anion interactions occur in probe 3 with the addition of F-, CN-, or H2PO4-. However, only a genuine hydrogen-bound complex forms in the presence of the OAc- ion in a DMSO solution of probe 3 because of the subtle difference in the pKa values of sulfonamide N−H protons when probes 2 and 3 are compared. Coordination of probe 1 to a ReI center or probe 2 to a RuII center increases the intrinsic acidity of sulfonamide N−H protons and results in an enhanced sensitivity to anions. },

Two examples, [(EtPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2) and [(MeBPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The solid state metrical parameters, in combination with infrared and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopic data, establish ferrous compounds with doubly reduced chelates. Each new bis(imino)pyridine iron dinitrogen compound was screened for the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl-3-methylbut-2-enoate, and the compound bearing the smallest aryl substituent, [(MePDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), offers significant improvement over the original (iPrPDI)Fe(N2)2 pre-catalyst and is one of the most active iron pre-catalysts known. },

	Abstract = { The reaction of [ReBr2(MeCN)(NO)(P∩P)] (P∩P = 1,1′-bisdiphenylphosphinoferrocene (dppfc) (1a), 1,1′-bisdiisopropylphosphinopherrocene (diprpfc) (1b), 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)diphenyl ether (dpephos) (1c), 10,11-dihydro-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)dibenzo[b,f]oxepine (homoxantphos) (1d) and 4,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-10,10-dimethylphenoxasilin (Sixantphos) (1e)) led in the presence of HSiEt3 and ethylene to formation of the ethylene hydride complexes [ReBrH(η2-C2H4)(NO)(P∩P)] (3a,b,d), the MeCN ethyl complex [ReBr(Et)(MeCN)(NO)(dpephos)] (5c) and two ortho-metalated stereoisomers of [ReBr(η2-C2H4)(NO)(η3-o-C6H4--Sixantphos)] 8e(up) and 8e(down). The complexes 3a,b,d, and 5c and the isomers of 8e showed high catalytic activity (TOFs ranging from 22 to 4870 h--1, TONs up to 24000) in the hydrogenation of monosubstituted olefins. For 8e(down) and 8e(up) a remarkable functional group tolerance and catalyst stability were noticed. Kinetic experiments revealed kobs to be first order in c(cat) and c(H2) and zeroth order in c(olefin). Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest the catalysis to proceed along an Osborn-type catalytic cycle with olefin before H2 addition. The unsaturated key intermediates [ReBrH(NO)(P∩P)] (2a--e) could be intercepted with MeCN as [ReBrH(MeCN)(NO)(P∩P)] (10a--d) complexes or isolated as dimeric μ2-(H)2 complexes [{ReBr(μ2-H)(NO)(P∩P)}2] (9b and 9e). Variation of the bidentate ligand demonstrated a crucial influence of the (large)-bite-angle on the catalytic performance and reactivity of 3a,b,d, 5c, and 8e. },

	Abstract = { Synthesis of the manganese and rhenium bis-NHC complexes fac-M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)3X (IiPr2Me2 = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene; M = Mn, X = Br, 1; M = Re, X = Cl, 2) is achieved by treatment of M(CO)5X with 2 equiv of the free carbene. Halide abstraction by NaBAr4F (BAr4F = B{C6H3(3,5-CF3)2}4) yields the spectroscopically characterized agostic species [M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)3]BAr4F (M = Mn, 3; M = Re, 4). These react rapidly with CO to form the tetracarbonyl compounds cis-[M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)4]BAr4F (M = Mn, 5; M = Re, 6). Addition of 1 equiv of IPr (1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) to M(CO)5X yields the monocarbene complexes M(IPr)(CO)4X (M = Mn, 8; M = Re, 9), which, in the case of Re, affords the dichloromethane complex [Re(IPr)(CO)4(CH2Cl2)]BAr4F (11) upon reaction with AgOTf/NaBAr4F. Removal of halide from 8 and 9 by AgOTf/NaBAr4F in the presence of CO affords the cationic pentacarbonyl species [M(IPr)(CO)5]BAr4F (M = Mn, 13; M = Re, 14). Complexes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14 have all been structurally characterized. },

	Abstract = {The development of rhenium(I) chemistry has been restricted by the limited structural and electronic variability of the common pseudo-octahedral products fac-[ReX(CO)3L2] (L2=α-diimine). We address this constraint by first preparing the bidentate bis(imino)pyridine complexes [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)3X] (X=Cl 2, Br 3), which were characterized by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic means, and then converting these species into tridentate pincer ligand compounds, [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2X] (X=Cl 4, Br 5). This transformation was performed in the solid-state by controlled heating of 2 or 3 above 200 $\,^{\circ}$C in a tube furnace under a flow of nitrogen gas, giving excellent yields (≥95 %). Compounds 4 and 5 define a new coordination environment for rhenium(I) carbonyl chemistry where the metal center is supported by a planar, tridentate pincer-coordinated bis(imino)pyridine ligand. The basic photophysical features of these compounds show significant elaboration in both number and intensity of the d--π* transitions observed in the UV/Vis spec tra relative to the bidentate starting materials, and these spectra were analyzed using time-dependent DFT computations. The redox nature of the bis(imino)pyridine ligand in compounds 2 and 4 was examined by electrochemical analysis, which showed two ligand reduction events and demonstrated that the ligand reduction shifts to a more positive potential when going from bidentate 2 to tridentate 4 (+160 mV for the first reduction step and +90 mV for the second). These observations indicate an increase in electrostatic stabilization of the reduced ligand in the tridentate conformation. Elaboration on this synthetic methodology documented its generality through the preparation of the pseudo-octahedral rhenium(I) triflate complex [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2OTf] (7, 93 % yield).},

	Abstract = {Two series of complexes [MX(diimine)(CO)3] (M = Tc, Re) have been prepared, fully characterised and investigated for their ability to act as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO. One series consists of complexes with different aromatic diimine ligands while keeping X = Br-- constant. The second series describes complexes with diimine = 2,2-bipyridine and variations in the anionic ligand X--. Although numerous complexes of this type have been prepared and investigated before, a systematic study of their photocatalytic activity has not yet been carried out. Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterisation of these complexes has been performed with the objective of better understanding their respective activity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.Despite various modifications, catalytic activity is retainedfor all compounds exhibiting fluorescence, including [99TcCl(bipy)(CO)3], whereas nonfluorescing compounds did not convert CO2 to CO. The correlation of catalytic activity and spectroscopic or electrochemical properties such as absorption or emission wavelengths, redox potentials or Stern--Volmer constants for the reductive quenching of the excited complexes is difficult. Nevertheless, the study emphasises the possibility to obtain [ReX(CO)3(diimine)] complexes with a wide range of physicochemical properties by ligand variations and the great potential of compounds of this class of complexes as inorganic photosensitisers.

	Abstract = {An analysis of the conjugative possibilities of dienes carrying two terminal heteroatom donors shows some generalizations of these as possible redox-active (redox ``noninnocent'') ligands. If the two E=C functionalities (E = O,S, NR, CHR) are connected by an odd number of sp2-hybridized atoms, full conjugation between the two terminal E donors is not possible, a situation which is found both in 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine (BIMPY) and beta-diketiminate ligands; the character of their redox noninnocence is thus altered, compared to 1,4-diheterodienes. Some insight into the BIMPY ligand comes from the analog where one imino arm is absent. The traditional stereochemical relationships which govern conjugation in arenes are analyzed for their implications for different bis(imino)pyridine isomers, and also for 2,6-dipyrimidyl- and dipyridazinyl-pyridines, as generalizations of the classic terpyridyl ligands. Factors which favor oxidized vs. reduced ligand forms are discussed.},

	Abstract = {[fac-Re(bpy) (CO)3Cl] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) is an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the selective and sustained photochemical or electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. A quantum yield of 14% and a faradic efficiency of 98% were measured in the presence of excess Cl− ions. The photochemical process took place under visible-light irradiation and consumed a tertiary amine as electron donor. A formato-rhenium complex was isolated in the absence of excess Cl− ions. Substitution by Cl− ion generated free formate, but no CO was detected. Luminescence measurements showed that the tertiary amine quenches the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer excited state of the rhenium complex via a reductive mechanism, with a rate constant of 3.4 × 107M−1S−1. The 19e-complex [Re(bpy) (CO)3X]− produced either photochemically or electrochemically appears to be the active precursor in the CO-generation process. Detailed spectroscopic studies on 13C-enriched carbonyl-rhenium and formato-rhenium complexes derived from 13C-enriched CO2 were performed in order to confirm the origin of the products and to study the exchange of the ligands. A mechanism for the present CO2 photoreduction process is presented; it involves separate pathways for CO and formate generation, in which the [Re(bpy) (CO)3X] complex plays the role of both the photoactive and the catalytic center.},
