	Abstract = {Alkene hydrosilylation, the addition of a silicon hydride (Si-H) across a carbon-carbon double bond, is one of the largest-scale industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis and is used in the commercial production of numerous consumer goods. For decades, precious metals, principally compounds of platinum and rhodium, have been used as catalysts for this reaction class. Despite their widespread application, limitations such as high and volatile catalyst costs and competing side reactions have persisted. Here, we report that well-characterized molecular iron coordination compounds promote the selective anti-Markovnikov addition of sterically hindered, tertiary silanes to alkenes under mild conditions. These Earth-abundant base-metal catalysts, coordinated by optimized bis(imino)pyridine ligands, show promise for industrial application.},

	Abstract = {Radiolabeled biomolecules can be used to visualize a variety of diseases through interaction with specific cell receptors. A key step is the introduction of a molecular entity that allows facile labeling with the medically useful radionuclide 99mTc without significant alteration of the structure and function of the biomolecule. One strategy focuses on the design of single amino acid chelates (SAACs){,} novel bifunctional chelators constructed from derivatized amino acids or amino acid analogues. The chelating terminus of the SAAC has been designed for effective coordination to the {99mTc(CO)3}+ core{,} while the other terminus allows incorporation into any position along a peptide sequence or into a variety of biomolecules. In applications to peptidic materials{,} the approach affords significant flexibility in the choice of donors for 99mTc coordination combined with the considerable advantages of routine solid phase synthetic techniques. The methodology allows libraries of peptide-based 99mTc(i) and 186{,}188Re(i) radiopharmaceuticals to prepared using conventional automated peptides synthesis. Other biomolecules{,} including nucleosides{,} carbohydrates{,} folic acid and vitamin B12 are also readily modified using analogous methods. The approach also allows the preparation of isostructural 99mTc and Re complexes for the correlation of in vivo and in vitro imaging studies.},

All new complexes 5-10{,} together with fac-[ReBr(CO)3(tpy)] (3) and fac-[Re(CH3CN)(CO)3(tpy)][PF6] (4){,} are characterized by solution spectroscopy; 3 and 5-9 are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The terpyridine ligands in 3 and 9 are in an unusual [small eta]2-bidentate coordination mode with a pendant pyridyl. Electrochemical studies showed successive metal-based oxidations and a ligand-centered reduction in 5-10. Significant oxidation changes are observed at the Ru(II) and Re(I) centers in 5-10 when compared with their respective monometallic components. Cubic nonlinearities of 5-10 determined by the Z-scan technique at 750 nm reveal two-photon absorption that increases significantly on progression from Ru(II) monomeric precursors to heterobimetallics{,} suggesting NLO enhancement upon heterometallic complex formation.},

In the absence of water and CO{,} reduction of -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl](dmbipy = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-dimethyl-2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridyl) leads first to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] followed by elimination of Cl and partial dimerisation of the resultant five-co-ordinate species to give both -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)] and [{Re(dmbipy)(CO)}]. Further reduction gives rise to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)]{,} which is the final product. Cathodic reduction of [Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl] in the presence of CO and absence of water leads to direct attack of CO on -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] to give [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)]{,} which can undergo further reduction to give [Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)(COH)]. By contrast{,} in the presence of HO{,} the complex can be protonated to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)] which is attacked by acetonitrile to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(MeCN)] and CO{,} this latter complex being identified unambiguously by comparison with the species formed in the of the original rhenium complex.},

	Abstract = {Under mild conditions pentacarbonylhalogenorhenium() complexes react with 2{,}2[prime or minute]:6[prime or minute]{,}2[double prime]-terpyridine (terpy) to form stable octahedral tricarbonyl complexes -[ReX(CO)(terpy)](X = Cl{,} Br or I) in which the terpyridine acts as a bidentate chelate ligand. Under more severe reaction conditions -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] can be converted to -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)]. In solution the tricarbonyl complexes are fluxional with the terpyridine oscillating between equivalent bidentate bonding modes. At low temperatures rotation of the unco-ordinated pyridine ring is restricted and in CDCl solution two preferred rotamers exist in approximately equal abundances. Rotational energy barriers have been estimated for the X = Cl and I complexes. The X-ray crystal structure of -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] confirms the bidentate chelate bonding of terpy with a N-Re-N angle of 74.3[degree]. The pendant pyridine ring is inclined at an angle of 52.9[degree] to the adjacent co-ordinated ring and the unco-ordinated nitrogen is directed towards the axial carbonyl and to Br.},

@article{walters2002,
	Abstract = { Stark emission spectroscopy, transient DC photoconductivity (TDCP), and ground-state dipole moment measurements have been used to evaluate charge transfer (CT) within various (X2-bipyridine)ReI(CO)3Cl complexes following 3MLCT excited-state formation. The Stark technique reports on vector differences between ground-state (μg) and excited-state (μe) dipole moments, while TDCP, when combined with independently obtained μg information, reports on scalar differences. For systems featuring collinear, same-signed ground- and excited-state dipole moments, the scalar and vector differences are equivalent. However, for the low symmetry systems studied here, they are distinctly different. The vector difference yields the effective adiabatic one-electron-transfer distance (R12), while the combined vector and scalar data yield information about dipole rotation upon ground-state/excited-state interconversion. For the systems examined, charge transfer distances are substantially smaller than geometric electron-donor/electron-acceptor site separation distances. The measured distances are significantly affected by changes in acceptor ligand substituent composition. Electron-donating substituents decrease CT distances, while electron-withdrawing substituents increase CT distances, as do aromatic substituents that are capable of expanding the bipyridyl ligand (acceptor ligand) π system. The Stark measurements additionally indicate that the CT vector and the transition dipole moment are significantly orthogonal, a consequence of strong polarization of the Re−Cl bond (orthogonal to the metal/acceptor-ligand plane) in the ground electronic state and relaxation of the polarization in the upper state. The ground-state Re−Cl bond polarization is sufficiently large that the overall ground-state scalar dipole moment exceeds the overall excited-state scalar dipole moment, despite transfer of an electron from the metal center to the diimine ligand. This finding provides an explanation for the otherwise puzzling negative solvatochromism exhibited in this family of compounds. Combining TDCP and Stark results, we find that the dipole moment can be rotated in some instances by more than 90$\,^{\circ}$ upon 3MLCT excited-state formation. The degree of rotation or reorientation can be modulated by changing the identity of the acceptor ligand substituents. Reorientational effects are smallest when the compounds feature aromatic substituents capable of spatially extending the π system of the acceptor ligand. },

	Abstract = { We report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical properties of a series of organic receptors and their corresponding ReI and RuII metal complexes as anion probes featuring bis(sulfonamide) interacting sites incorporating highly chromophoric π-conjugated quinoxaline moieties. The interactions with various anions were extensively investigated. These probe molecules are capable of recognizing F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4- with different sensitivities. The probe−anion interactions can be easily visualized via naked-eye colorimetric or luminescent responses. Probe 1 has the weakest acidic sulfonamide N−H protons and therefore simply forms hydrogen-bonding complexes with F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4-. Probe 2 undergoes a stepwise process with the addition of F- and OAc-:  formation of a hydrogen-bound complex followed by sulfonamide N−H deprotonation. Direct sulfonamide N−H deprotonation occurs upon the addition of CN-, while only a hydrogen-bound complex forms with the H2PO4- ion for probe 2 in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. Similar probe−anion interactions occur in probe 3 with the addition of F-, CN-, or H2PO4-. However, only a genuine hydrogen-bound complex forms in the presence of the OAc- ion in a DMSO solution of probe 3 because of the subtle difference in the pKa values of sulfonamide N−H protons when probes 2 and 3 are compared. Coordination of probe 1 to a ReI center or probe 2 to a RuII center increases the intrinsic acidity of sulfonamide N−H protons and results in an enhanced sensitivity to anions. },

In contrast to reduction with sodium amalgam where bis(chelate) iron compounds were isolated, stirring (ArPDI)FeBr2 or (MeBPDI)FeBr2 (PDI = 2,6-(ArN═CMe)2C5H3N; Ar = 2,6-Et2-C6H3N (EtPDI), 2,6-Me2-C6H3N (MePDI), 2-iPr,6-Me-C6H3N (Me,iPrPDI); MeBPDI = 2,6-(2,6-Me2-C6H3N═CPh)2C5H3N) with sodium naphthalenide resulted in isolation of the desired iron dinitrogen compounds as diamagnetic solids. Two examples, [(EtPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2) and [(MeBPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The solid state metrical parameters, in combination with infrared and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopic data, establish ferrous compounds with doubly reduced chelates. Each new bis(imino)pyridine iron dinitrogen compound was screened for the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl-3-methylbut-2-enoate, and the compound bearing the smallest aryl substituent, [(MePDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), offers significant improvement over the original (iPrPDI)Fe(N2)2 pre-catalyst and is one of the most active iron pre-catalysts known. },

	Abstract = { The reaction of [ReBr2(MeCN)(NO)(P∩P)] (P∩P = 1,1′-bisdiphenylphosphinoferrocene (dppfc) (1a), 1,1′-bisdiisopropylphosphinopherrocene (diprpfc) (1b), 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)diphenyl ether (dpephos) (1c), 10,11-dihydro-4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)dibenzo[b,f]oxepine (homoxantphos) (1d) and 4,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-10,10-dimethylphenoxasilin (Sixantphos) (1e)) led in the presence of HSiEt3 and ethylene to formation of the ethylene hydride complexes [ReBrH(η2-C2H4)(NO)(P∩P)] (3a,b,d), the MeCN ethyl complex [ReBr(Et)(MeCN)(NO)(dpephos)] (5c) and two ortho-metalated stereoisomers of [ReBr(η2-C2H4)(NO)(η3-o-C6H4--Sixantphos)] 8e(up) and 8e(down). The complexes 3a,b,d, and 5c and the isomers of 8e showed high catalytic activity (TOFs ranging from 22 to 4870 h--1, TONs up to 24000) in the hydrogenation of monosubstituted olefins. For 8e(down) and 8e(up) a remarkable functional group tolerance and catalyst stability were noticed. Kinetic experiments revealed kobs to be first order in c(cat) and c(H2) and zeroth order in c(olefin). Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest the catalysis to proceed along an Osborn-type catalytic cycle with olefin before H2 addition. The unsaturated key intermediates [ReBrH(NO)(P∩P)] (2a--e) could be intercepted with MeCN as [ReBrH(MeCN)(NO)(P∩P)] (10a--d) complexes or isolated as dimeric μ2-(H)2 complexes [{ReBr(μ2-H)(NO)(P∩P)}2] (9b and 9e). Variation of the bidentate ligand demonstrated a crucial influence of the (large)-bite-angle on the catalytic performance and reactivity of 3a,b,d, 5c, and 8e. },

	Abstract = { Synthesis of the manganese and rhenium bis-NHC complexes fac-M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)3X (IiPr2Me2 = 1,3-diisopropyl-4,5-dimethylimidazol-2-ylidene; M = Mn, X = Br, 1; M = Re, X = Cl, 2) is achieved by treatment of M(CO)5X with 2 equiv of the free carbene. Halide abstraction by NaBAr4F (BAr4F = B{C6H3(3,5-CF3)2}4) yields the spectroscopically characterized agostic species [M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)3]BAr4F (M = Mn, 3; M = Re, 4). These react rapidly with CO to form the tetracarbonyl compounds cis-[M(IiPr2Me2)2(CO)4]BAr4F (M = Mn, 5; M = Re, 6). Addition of 1 equiv of IPr (1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene) to M(CO)5X yields the monocarbene complexes M(IPr)(CO)4X (M = Mn, 8; M = Re, 9), which, in the case of Re, affords the dichloromethane complex [Re(IPr)(CO)4(CH2Cl2)]BAr4F (11) upon reaction with AgOTf/NaBAr4F. Removal of halide from 8 and 9 by AgOTf/NaBAr4F in the presence of CO affords the cationic pentacarbonyl species [M(IPr)(CO)5]BAr4F (M = Mn, 13; M = Re, 14). Complexes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 14 have all been structurally characterized. },

	Abstract = {The development of rhenium(I) chemistry has been restricted by the limited structural and electronic variability of the common pseudo-octahedral products fac-[ReX(CO)3L2] (L2=α-diimine). We address this constraint by first preparing the bidentate bis(imino)pyridine complexes [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)3X] (X=Cl 2, Br 3), which were characterized by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic means, and then converting these species into tridentate pincer ligand compounds, [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2X] (X=Cl 4, Br 5). This transformation was performed in the solid-state by controlled heating of 2 or 3 above 200 $\,^{\circ}$C in a tube furnace under a flow of nitrogen gas, giving excellent yields (≥95 %). Compounds 4 and 5 define a new coordination environment for rhenium(I) carbonyl chemistry where the metal center is supported by a planar, tridentate pincer-coordinated bis(imino)pyridine ligand. The basic photophysical features of these compounds show significant elaboration in both number and intensity of the d--π* transitions observed in the UV/Vis spec tra relative to the bidentate starting materials, and these spectra were analyzed using time-dependent DFT computations. The redox nature of the bis(imino)pyridine ligand in compounds 2 and 4 was examined by electrochemical analysis, which showed two ligand reduction events and demonstrated that the ligand reduction shifts to a more positive potential when going from bidentate 2 to tridentate 4 (+160 mV for the first reduction step and +90 mV for the second). These observations indicate an increase in electrostatic stabilization of the reduced ligand in the tridentate conformation. Elaboration on this synthetic methodology documented its generality through the preparation of the pseudo-octahedral rhenium(I) triflate complex [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2OTf] (7, 93 % yield).},

	Abstract = {Two series of complexes [MX(diimine)(CO)3] (M = Tc, Re) have been prepared, fully characterised and investigated for their ability to act as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO. One series consists of complexes with different aromatic diimine ligands while keeping X = Br-- constant. The second series describes complexes with diimine = 2,2-bipyridine and variations in the anionic ligand X--. Although numerous complexes of this type have been prepared and investigated before, a systematic study of their photocatalytic activity has not yet been carried out. Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterisation of these complexes has been performed with the objective of better understanding their respective activity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.Despite various modifications, catalytic activity is retainedfor all compounds exhibiting fluorescence, including [99TcCl(bipy)(CO)3], whereas nonfluorescing compounds did not convert CO2 to CO. The correlation of catalytic activity and spectroscopic or electrochemical properties such as absorption or emission wavelengths, redox potentials or Stern--Volmer constants for the reductive quenching of the excited complexes is difficult. Nevertheless, the study emphasises the possibility to obtain [ReX(CO)3(diimine)] complexes with a wide range of physicochemical properties by ligand variations and the great potential of compounds of this class of complexes as inorganic photosensitisers.

	Abstract = {An analysis of the conjugative possibilities of dienes carrying two terminal heteroatom donors shows some generalizations of these as possible redox-active (redox ``noninnocent'') ligands. If the two E=C functionalities (E = O,S, NR, CHR) are connected by an odd number of sp2-hybridized atoms, full conjugation between the two terminal E donors is not possible, a situation which is found both in 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine (BIMPY) and beta-diketiminate ligands; the character of their redox noninnocence is thus altered, compared to 1,4-diheterodienes. Some insight into the BIMPY ligand comes from the analog where one imino arm is absent. The traditional stereochemical relationships which govern conjugation in arenes are analyzed for their implications for different bis(imino)pyridine isomers, and also for 2,6-dipyrimidyl- and dipyridazinyl-pyridines, as generalizations of the classic terpyridyl ligands. Factors which favor oxidized vs. reduced ligand forms are discussed.},

	Abstract = {[fac-Re(bpy) (CO)3Cl] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) is an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the selective and sustained photochemical or electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. A quantum yield of 14% and a faradic efficiency of 98% were measured in the presence of excess Cl− ions. The photochemical process took place under visible-light irradiation and consumed a tertiary amine as electron donor. A formato-rhenium complex was isolated in the absence of excess Cl− ions. Substitution by Cl− ion generated free formate, but no CO was detected. Luminescence measurements showed that the tertiary amine quenches the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer excited state of the rhenium complex via a reductive mechanism, with a rate constant of 3.4 × 107M−1S−1. The 19e-complex [Re(bpy) (CO)3X]− produced either photochemically or electrochemically appears to be the active precursor in the CO-generation process. Detailed spectroscopic studies on 13C-enriched carbonyl-rhenium and formato-rhenium complexes derived from 13C-enriched CO2 were performed in order to confirm the origin of the products and to study the exchange of the ligands. A mechanism for the present CO2 photoreduction process is presented; it involves separate pathways for CO and formate generation, in which the [Re(bpy) (CO)3X] complex plays the role of both the photoactive and the catalytic center.},
