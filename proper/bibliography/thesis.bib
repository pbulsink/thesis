Kinetic measurements concerning the photocatalytic two electron reduction of CO2 to CO were investigated in order to determine the influence of intermolecular interactions between two active centers. A detailed comparison between the monometallic and the bimetallic complexes indicates an enhanced lifetime (TON) of the covalently linked complexes{,} causing an increased overall conversion of CO2.

Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterization of these complexes in CH3CN suggests that the three methylene units effectively insulate the bipyridyl rings and the rhenium center from the electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorinated alkyl chains. Reductive quenching of the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer excited states with triethylamine reveals quenching rate constants in supercritical CO2 that are only 6 times slower than those in CH3CN. },

	Abstract = {A series of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ (L=CO2, C(O)OH, CO, CHO, CH2OH, CH3, and C(O)CH3; n=0, 1, 2) were prepared and their molecular structures determined by X-ray analyses. These complexes are reasonable models of reaction intermediates in the multi-electron reduction of \{CO2\} catalyzed by metal complexes, since reductive cleavage of the Ru-L bonds of the complexes in protic media affords HCOOH, CO, HCHO, CH3OH, and \{CH4\} as two-, four-, six- and eight-electron reduction products of CO2. Thermodynamically, the free energy required in the reduction of \{CO2\} progressively decreases with an increase of the number of electrons participating in the reduction of CO2. The Ru-L bond character of the series of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ was assessed by the ν(Ru-L) bands and the Ru-L bond distances from the viewpoint of elucidation of a correlation between free energy changes in the multi-electron reduction of \{CO2\} catalyzed by metal complexes and the metal-carbon bond strength of each intermediate. The ruthenium-carbon bond distance of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ largely depends on the hybrid orbital of the carbon atom bonded to ruthenium and lengthens in the order Ru-Csp&lt;Ru-Csp2&lt;Ru-Csp3. An unusual shift of the ν(Ru-L) bands to higher wavenumber with decrease of the Ru-L bond distances was discussed in terms of σ- and π-character of the ruthenium-carbon bonds. },

@article{doherty2010,
	Abstract = {Rhenium(I) and ruthenium(II) complexes have been successfully used for photochemical \{CO2\} reduction to \{CO\} or formate. However, a typical turnover frequency for such reactions is 20\^−1 and the formation of reduced species beyond \{CO\} or formate is very limited. In the case of the rhenium(I) bipyridyl tricarbonyl system, the key intermediate has been shown to decay with a first-order dependence on [CO2] to produce CO, which is the rate-determining step. The limited concentration of dissolved \{CO2\} in organic solvents results in extremely slow \{CO2\} reduction. To improve the reaction rate, we prepared new CO2-soluble rhenium(I) bipyridine complexes bearing fluorinated alkyl ligands and investigated their photophysical properties in \{CH3CN\} and supercritical CO2. We also investigated the properties of a metal complex with an NAD+ model ligand, [Ru(bpy)2(pbn)]2+ (bpy=2,2′-bipyridine, pbn=2-(2-pyridyl)-benzo[b]-1,5-naphthyridine), and prepared the corresponding NADH-like complex [Ru(bpy)2(pbnHH)]2+ upon \{MLCT\} excitation followed by reductive quenching. This species can be used as a renewable hydride donor. The electrochemical and photochemical properties, and the reactivity of these species toward \{CO2\} reduction were investigated. },

@article{schneider2011,
	Abstract = { The photochemistry and photophysics of the cationic molecular dyad, 5-{4-[rhenium(I)tricarbonylpicoline-4-methyl-2,2′-bipyridine-4′-carboxyamidyl]phenyl}-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinatopalladium(II) ([Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy-PdTPP][PF6]) have been investigated. The single crystal X-ray structure for the thiocyanate analogue, [Re(CO)3(NCS)Bpy-PdTPP], exhibits torsion angles of 69.1(9)$\,^{\circ}$, 178.1(7)$\,^{\circ}$, and 156.8(9)$\,^{\circ}$ between porphyrin plane, porphyrin-linked C6H4 group, amide moiety, and Bpy, respectively. Steady-state photoexcitation (λex = 520 nm) of [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy-PdTPP][PF6] in dimethylformamide (DMF) results in substitution of Pic by bromide at the Re(I)Bpy core. When [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy-PdTPP][PF6] is employed as a photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO in DMF/NEt3 solution with λex > 420 nm, 2 turnovers (TNs) CO are formed after 4 h. If instead, a two-component mixture of PdTPP sensitizer and mononuclear [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy][PF6] catalyst is used, 3 TNs CO are formed. In each experiment however, CO only forms after a slight induction period and during the concurrent photoreduction of the sensitizer to a Pd(II) chlorin species. Palladium(II) meso-tetraphenylchlorin, the hydrogenated porphyrin analogue of PdTPP, has been synthesized independently and can be substituted for PdTPP in the two-component system with [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy][PF6], forming 9 TNs CO. An intramolecular electron transfer process for the dyad is supported by cyclic voltammetry and steady-state emission studies, from which the free energy change was calculated to be ΔGox* = −0.08 eV. Electron transfer from Pd(II) porphyrin to Re(I) tricarbonyl bipyridine in [Re(CO)3(Pic)Bpy-PdTPP][PF6] was monitored using time-resolved infrared (TRIR) spectroscopy in the ν(CO) region on several time scales with excitation at 532 nm. Spectra were recorded in CH2Cl2 with and without NEt3. Picosecond TRIR spectroscopy shows rapid growth of bands assigned to the π--π* excited state (2029 cm--1) and to the charge-separated state (2008, 1908 cm--1); these bands decay and the parent recovers with lifetimes of 20--50 ps. Spectra recorded on longer time scales (ns, μs, and seconds) show the growth and decay of further species with ν(CO) bands indicative of electron transfer to Re(Bpy). },

	Abstract = {The potential of a number of tetraaza-macrocyclic complexes of cobalt and nickel to mediate the photoreduction of carbon dioxide has been studied. Carbon monoxide and hydrogen are the main products, which result from illumination of an aqueous solution containing Ru(2, 2′-bipyridine)2+3 as sensitizer, ascorbic acid as sacrificial eletron donor and a tetraaza-macrocyclic complex as relay. Their ratio strongly depends upon the relay compound used. The complexes can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction at a mercury electrode since they lower the overpotential for CO2 reduction showing turnover numbers/hour of approximately 3. A minimum potential is required to induce reaction of electrocatalysts and CO2 (and H2O).Finally, the redox properties of the macrocyclic metal complexes at p-GaP and p-GaAs photocathodes in acetonitrile are compared with those observed at Pt.},

@article{dhanasekaran1999,
	Abstract = { Iron and cobalt porphyrins (FeP and CoP) are utilized as electron-transfer mediators to effect photochemical reduction of CO2 in homogeneous solutions. The species that activate and reduce CO2 are the Fe0P and Co0P formed by reduction of the starting materials. Reduction of the metalloporphyrins (MP) is achieved by photolysis in dimethylformamide or acetonitrile solutions containing triethylamine (TEA) as a reductive quencher. The photoreduction is efficient for the MIIIP → MIIP stage and probably occurs by an intramolecular electron transfer from an axially bound TEA. However, TEA does not bind to the reduced metal complexes, and the quantum efficiency is much lower for the subsequent reduction steps. Considerably higher quantum yields are obtained by adding p-terphenyl (TP) as a sensitizer. TP is very effectively photoreduced by TEA to form the radical anion, TP*-, which has a sufficiently negative reduction potential to reduce CoIP and FeIP rapidly to their M0P state. The rate constants for these reactions, determined by pulse radiolysis, are found to be nearly diffusion-controlled. The quantum yield for the reduction of MIIP to MIP and for reduction of CO2 to CO are increased by more than an order of magnitude in the presence of TP. Side reactions involve hydrogenation of the porphyrin ring and production of H2. The hydrogenated porphyrins also catalyze reduction of CO2, but the photochemical production of CO eventually stops. This limit on catalytic activity is due to destruction of the porphyrin macrocycle and accumulation of CO. CO can bind strongly to FeIIP and to FeIP but not to Fe0P, as demonstrated by electrochemical measurements and by optical spectra of the species produced by sodium reduction in tetrahydrofuran in the presence and absence of CO. Although binding of CO to FeIIP and FeIP should not interfere with the formation of Fe0P, the active catalyst, the potential for reduction of FeIP to Fe0P becomes more negative. However, CO probably binds to the hydrogenated products thereby inhibiting the catalytic process. },

	Abstract = {Comparisons of resource assessments suggest that sufficient renewable energy resources are available to allow for large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies. Economic analysis identifies barriers to the adoption of renewable energy sources resulting from (i) market structure, (ii) competition in an uneven playing field, and (iii) various non-marketplace barriers. However, even if these barriers are removed, the problem of `technology lock-out' remains. The key policy response is strategic deployment coupled with increased R&D support to accelerate the pace of improvement through market experience. This paper suggests significant contributions from various technologies are possible, but does not assess their optimal or maximal market share.},

	Abstract = {The ability of carbon dioxide to act as a ligand in transition metal complexes is now well documented and several coordination modes of \{CO2\} have been described. Spectroscopic methodologies allowing the characterization of \{CO2\} complexes even if crystallographic data are not available have now been developed. The binding of \{CO2\} to a metal centre generally leads to ``activation'' of the \{CO2\} molecule, and various reactions of coordinated \{CO2\} are known. However, activation by coordination is not a necessary prerequisite for catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to useful chemicals. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that only weak interactions between \{CO2\} and the active metal centre are sufficient to bring about catalytic reactions involving the formal insertion of \{CO2\} in an MX bond as a key step. },

@article{song2006,
	Abstract = {Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for \{CO2\} utilization include: (1) costs of \{CO2\} capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of \{CO2\} chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use \{CO2\} for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use \{CO2\} to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use \{CO2\} as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use \{CO2\} recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing \{CO2\} utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without \{CO2\} separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of \{CO2\} selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, O2, and N2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with \{CO2\} as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of \{CO2\} based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use \{CO2\} based on the unique chemical properties for \{CO2\} to be incorporated with high `atom efficiency' such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using \{CO2\} as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use \{CO2\} for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle \{CO2\} as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert \{CO2\} under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into ``new fossil'' energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known \{CO2\} reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using \{CO2\} along with \{H2O\} and \{O2\} in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of \{CO2\} reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H2/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a \{CO2\} ``molecular basket'' as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI). The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either \{PEI\} or MCM-41 alone and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances \{CO2\} adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using \{CO2\} and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical \{CO2\} for extraction and for chemical processing where \{CO2\} is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The \{CO2\} utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input. },

	Abstract = { The Re(NN)(CO)3(THF) (NN = bpy = 2,2`-bipyridine or dmb = 4,4`-dimethyl-2,2`-bipyridine) radical, produced by homolysis of [Re(NN)(CO)3]2 in THF solution by visible irradiation, dimerizes with rate constants kd = 20 $\pm$ 3 and 11 $\pm$ 4 M-1 s-1 for NN = dmb and bpy, respectively. The dimerization processes are strikingly slow compared to those of typical metal radicals including Re(CO)5 (kd ≈ 109 M-1 s-1). In order to explain such slow reactions, we have performed B3LYP hybrid DFT and fully ab initio RHF and MP2 calculations on several conformations of [Re(bpy)(CO)3]2 (cis, trans, skewed cis, skewed trans) and [Re(CO)5]2 (staggered) and on their constituent monomer radicals and anions. The calculations show that the most stable geometry of [Re(bpy)(CO)3]2 is skewed cis, and the experimental infrared spectrum and photochemical properties of the [Re(bpy)(CO)3]2 dimer are best described by the calculated properties of the skewed cis conformer in which there is no low-lying unoccupied orbital that is predominantly σMM* in character. The Re(bpy)(CO)3(THF) ligand radical is more stable than the 5-coordinate ``17-electron'' metal radical, Re(bpy)(CO)3, suggesting that the extremely slow dimerization rate most likely arises from the solvent blocking the binding site (i.e., the estimated fraction of the five-coordinate monomer is 1.6 × 10-2). Theoretical results are consistent with our experimental results that the dimerization process proceeds via the Re centered radical, which is involved in a pre-equilibrium favoring the ligand-centered radical. Furthermore, time-dependent DFT calculations on [Re(bpy)(CO)3]2 and [Re(bpy)(CO)3]- identify the origin of UV−vis absorption in THF. },

	Abstract = {Deacetoxycephalosporin C synthase (DAOCS) is an iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of penicillin N to deacetoxycephalosporin C, the committed step in the biosynthesis of cephalosporin antibiotics. The crystal structure of \{DAOCS\} revealed that the C terminus of one molecule is inserted into the active site of its neighbor in a cyclical fashion within a trimeric unit. This arrangement has hindered the generation of crystalline enzyme-substrate complexes. Therefore, we constructed a series of \{DAOCS\} mutants with modified C termini. Oxidation of 2-oxoglutarate was significantly uncoupled from oxidation of the penicillin substrate in certain truncated mutants. The extent of uncoupling varied with the number of residues deleted and the penicillin substrate used. Crystal structures were determined for the ΔR306 mutant complexed with iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (to 2.10 {\AA}) and the ΔR306A mutant complexed with iron(II), succinate and unhydrated carbon dioxide (to 1.96 {\AA}). The latter may mimic a product complex, and supports proposals for a metal-bound \{CO2\} intermediate during catalysis. },

	Abstract = { Despite intensive experimental and computational studies, some important features of the mechanism of the photosynthetic CO2-fixing enzyme, Rubisco, are still not understood. To complement our previous investigation of the first catalytic step, the enolization of d-ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (King et al., Biochemistry 1998, 44, 15414−15422), we present the first complete computational dissection of subsequent steps of the carboxylation reaction that includes the roles of the central magnesium ion and modeled residues of the active site. We investigated carboxylation, hydration, and C−C bond cleavage using the density functional method and the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to perform geometry optimizations. The energies were determined by B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) single-point calculations. We modeled a fragment of the active site and substrate, taking into account experimental findings that the residues coordinated to the Mg ion, especially the carbamylated Lys-201, play critical roles in this reaction sequence. The carbamate appears to act as a general base, not only for enolization but also for hydration of the β ketoacid formed by addition of CO2 and, as well, cleavage of the C2−C3 bond of the hydrate. We show that CO2 is added directly, without assistance of a Michaelis complex, and that hydration of the resultant β ketoacid occurs in a separate subsequent step with a discrete transition state. We suggest that two conformations of the hydrate (gem-diol), with different metal coordination, are possible. The step with the highest activation energy during the carboxylation cycle is the C−C bond cleavage. Depending on the conformations of the gem-diol, different pathways are possible for this step. In either case, special arrangements of the metal coordination result in bond breaking occurring at remarkably low activation energies (between 28 and 37 kcal mol-1) which might be reduced further in the enzyme environment. },

A compositionally pure sample of 2 was obtained by dissolving a mixture of 2 and 3 in dry pyridine and layering the resulting solution with toluene. Solid state magnetic susceptibility measurements on 1 reveal Curie−Weiss paramagnetic behavior with a molar magnetic moment of 5.12(1) μB between 20 and 300 K, a value which is in line with the expected iron(II) spin-only value of 4.90 μB. The magnetic measurements carried out on 2 reveal more complex temperature dependent behavior consistent with intramolecular antiferromagnetic coupling (J = −46 cm−1) between the unpaired electrons of the iron(II) ion (SFe = 2) and a π* orbital of the bipyridyl radical (Sbipy = 1/2). Structural data, M{\"o}ssbauer and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations are all consistent with this model of the electronic structure. To the best of our knowledge, species 2 represents the first crystallographically characterized transition metal complex of the 2,2′-bipyridyl ligand for which magnetic, spectroscopic, and computational data indicate the presence of an unpaired electron in the π* antibonding orbital. },

These species were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction in K(2,2′-bipy)(en) (1a), K4(2,2′-bipy)4(en)4 (1b), Rb2(2,2′-bipy)(en)2 (2), K(2,4′-bipy)(en) (3), K4(2,4′-bipy)2(en)3.5 (4), and Rb4(2,4′-bipy)2(en)3.5 (5). The crystallographic results obtained allow for interesting relationships to be drawn between the electronic structure of the bipyridyl moieties and metric structural data. Further characterization of the solids by means of powder X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, and IR and Raman spectroscopy is also reported. These studies provide a comprehensive overview of the structural and spectroscopic properties of these often-cited yet elusive air- and moisture-sensitive species, helping to complement the existing data in the chemical literature. },

@article{lyaskovskyy2012,
	Abstract = { In this (tutorial overview) perspective we highlight the use of ``redox non-innocent'' ligands in catalysis. Two main types of reactivity in which the redox non-innocent ligand is involved can be specified: (A) The redox active ligand participates in the catalytic cycle only by accepting/donating electrons, and (B) the ligand actively participates in the formation/breaking of substrate covalent bonds. On the basis of these two types of behavior, four main application strategies of redox-active ligands in catalysis can be distinguished: The first strategy (I) involves oxidation/reduction of the ligand to tune the electronic properties (i.e., Lewis acidity/basicity) of the metal. In the second approach (II) the ligand is used as an electron reservoir. This allows multiple-electron transformations for metal complexes that are reluctant to such transformations otherwise (e.g., because the metal would need to accommodate an uncommon, high-energy oxidation state). This includes examples of (first row) transition metals that have a tendency to react via one-electron pathways, and even ``oxidative addition'' reactions for d0 transition metal complexes become possible with redox active ligands as electron reservoirs. The electron-reservoir function of the ligand tolerates the metal to maintain its most common or most stable oxidation state by delivering or accepting the electron density associated with the multielectron transformation (most typically two-electron transformations such as oxidative addition/reductive elimination). The third strategy (III) involves the generation of reactive ligand-radicals that actively participate in the making and breaking of chemical bonds during catalysis. Cooperative substrate activation by the redox non-innocent ligand and the metal allows reactions that are difficult to achieve otherwise. The last strategy (IV) involves (radical-type) activation of the substrates or modification of the substrate reactivity in cases where the substrate itself acts as a redox non-innocent ligand. These four approaches are illustrated by recent literature data. },

	Abstract = {The effective design of an artificial photosynthetic system entails the optimization of several important interactions. Herein we report stopped-flow UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallographic, density functional theory (DFT), and electrochemical kinetic studies of the Re(bipy-tBu)(CO)3(L) catalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO. A remarkable selectivity for CO2 over H+ was observed by stopped-flow UV-vis spectroscopy of [Re(bipy-tBu)(CO)3]-1. The reaction with CO2 is about 25 times faster than the reaction with water or methanol at the same concentrations. X-ray crystallography and DFT studies of the doubly reduced anionic species suggest that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) has mixed metal-ligand character rather than being purely doubly occupied , which is believed to determine selectivity by favoring CO2 (σ + π) over H+ (σ only) binding. Electrocatalytic studies performed with the addition of Br{\"o}nsted acids reveal a primary H/D kinetic isotope effect, indicating that transfer of protons to Re -CO2 is involved in the rate limiting step. Lastly, the effects of electrode surface modification on interfacial electron transfer between a semiconductor and catalyst were investigated and found to affect the observed current densities for catalysis more than threefold, indicating that the properties of the electrode surface need to be addressed when developing a homogeneous artificial photosynthetic system.},

@article{johnson1996,
	Abstract = { This article describes the results of an IR spectroelectrochemical study of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide using the complexes [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]n (bpy = 2,2`-bipyridine; n = 0, L = Cl-, CF3SO3-; n = +1, L = CH3CN, P(OEt)3) as catalyst precursors. The study was performed for the first time with an optically transparent thin-layer electrochemical (OTTLE) cell. The results confirm unambiguously the catalytic activity of the reduced five-coordinate complexes, the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy)]* and the anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)]-. The catalytic behavior of these species could be investigated separately for the first time due to the application of complexes other than those with L = halide, whose catalytic routes may involve simultaneously both radical and anionic catalysis depending on the solvent used. The complex [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl], so far the most studied catalyst precursor, upon one-electron reduction gives the corresponding radical-anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl]*-, which was previously believed to react directly with CO2. By contrast, this study demonstrates its stability toward attack by CO2, which may only take place after dissociation of the chloride ligand. This conclusion also applies to other six-coordinate radicals [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]* (L = CH3CN (in CH3CN) and P(OEt)3) whose catalytic route requires subsequent one-electron reduction to produce the anionic catalyst [Re(CO)3(bpy)]- (the 2e pathway). The catalytic route of [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl] in CH3CN therefore deviates from that of the related [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)Cl], the other complex studied by IR (reflectance) spectroelectrochemistry, with the more basic ligand, 4,4`-dimethyl-2,2`-bipyridine (dmbpy). The latter complex tends to form the five-coordinate radicals [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)]*, capable of CO2 reduction (the 1e pathway), even in CH3CN, hence eliminating the possibility of the 2e pathway via the anion [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)]-, which operates in the case of the 2,2`-bipyridine complex. For [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]n (n = 0, L = Cl-, CF3SO3-; n = +1, L = CH3CN), the 1e catalytic route becomes possible in weakly coordinating THF, due to the instability of the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy)(THF)]*. The inherent stability of the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy){P(OEt)3}]* was found convenient for the investigation of the 2e pathway via [Re(CO)3(bpy)]-. The main, spectroscopically observed products of the CO2 reduction are, independent of the 1e and 2e catalytic routes, CO, CO32-, and free CO2H-. The latter product is formed via one-electron reduction of the radical anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)(CO2H)]*-, which is the main byproduct in the catalytic cycle. },

All of the complexes showed an intense broad structureless emission band in dichloromethane at around 680--708 nm, which originated from an excited state of intraligand charge transfer (3ILCT) character from the triarylamine to the bipyridine moiety. Upon introduction of the bulky and electron-donating pentaphenylbenzene units attached to the aniline groups, the emission bands were found to be red shifted. The nanosecond transient absorption spectra of two selected complexes were studied, which were suggestive of the formation of an initial charge-separated state. Computational studies have been performed to provide further insight into the origin of the absorption and emission. One of the rhenium(I) complexes has been utilized in the fabrication of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), representing the first example of the realization of deep red to near-infrared rhenium(I)-based OLEDs with an emission extending up to 800 nm.},

@article{grills2014,
	Abstract = { We describe a new strategy for enhancing the efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction with a homogeneous catalyst, using a room-temperature ionic liquid as both the solvent and electrolyte. The electrochemical behavior of fac-ReCl(2,2′-bipyridine)(CO)3 in neat 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate ([emim][TCB]) was compared with that in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M [Bu4N][PF6]. Two separate one-electron reductions occur in acetonitrile (−1.74 and −2.11 V vs Fc+/0), with a modest catalytic current appearing at the second reduction wave under CO2. However, in [emim][TCB], a two-electron reduction wave appears at −1.66 V, resulting in a ∼0.45 V lower overpotential for catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the apparent CO2 reduction rate constant, kapp, in [emim][TCB] exceeds that in acetonitrile by over one order of magnitude (kapp = 4000 vs 100 M--1 s--1) at 25 $\pm$ 3 $\,^{\circ}$C. Supported by time-resolved infrared measurements, a mechanism is proposed in which an interaction between [emim]+ and the two-electron reduced catalyst results in rapid dissociation of chloride and a decrease in the activation energy for CO2 reduction. },

@article{agarwal2012b,
	Abstract = { The chemical conversion of CO2 has been studied by numerous experimental groups. Particularly the use of rhenium tricarbonyl-based molecular catalysts has attracted interest owing to their ability to absorb light, store redox equivalents, and convert CO2 into higher-energy products. The mechanism by which these catalysts mediate reduction, particularly to CO and HCOO--, is poorly understood, and studies aimed at elucidating the reaction pathway have likely been hindered by the large number of species present in solution. Herein the mechanism for carbon monoxide production using rhenium tricarbonyl catalysts has been investigated using density functional theory. The investigation presented proceeds from the experimental work of Meyer's group (J. Chem. Soc., Chem. Commun.1985, 1414--1416) in DMSO and Fujita's group (J. Am. Chem. Soc.2003, 125, 11976--11987) in dry DMF. The latter work with a simplified reaction mixture, one that removes the photo-induced reduction step with a sacrificial donor, is used for validation of the proposed mechanism, which involves formation of a rhenium carboxylate dimer, [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO), where dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine. CO2 insertion into this species, and subsequent rearrangement, is proposed to yield CO and the carbonate-bridged [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO2). Structures and energies for the proposed reaction path are presented and compared to previously published experimental observations. },

@article{agarwal2011,
	Abstract = { Tricarbonyl rhenium(I) complexes, such as Re(bpy)(CO)3Cl where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridyl, have demonstrated superior activity in catalyzing CO2 reduction in the presence of sacrificial electron donors. We have utilized density functional theory (DFT) to investigate a potential pathway for formate production via a rhenium−hydride insertion mechanism in the presence of triethylamine (TEA). On the basis of prior studies, we re-examined the role of TEA and studied a catalytic cycle for CO2 reduction in which TEA functions as both the hydrogen atom and the electron donor for reducing CO2 into formate. The catalytic cycle is found to be exothermic with inclusion of solvation and may be viewed as a two-electron reduction of CO2 because the net result is a transfer of hydride from TEA to CO2. In addition, we have identified structures of key intermediates in the CO2-reduction process and found that the insertion step has a very modest barrier in acetonitrile. These findings provide a molecular-level understanding to formate production via CO2 reduction mediated by transition-metal complexes. A theoretical investigation is underway to elucidate the formation of carbon monoxide, another common product in Re-catalyzed CO2 reduction. },

@article{machan2014,
	Abstract = { The use of infrared spectroelectrochemistry (IR-SEC) as a characterization method for molecular electrocatalysts allows researchers to identify key intermediates and products during the course of an electrochemical reaction. Since such reactions are driven by the application of potential, properly designed cells allow for the examination of the stepwise formation of active species and their subsequent reactivity with substrate. These results can be compared to and independently verified by the concomitant generation of similar species by chemical means. Recently we have used such an approach to characterize the catalytically relevant species and products for the reduction of CO2 by 2,2′-bipyridyl-based ReI and MnI fac-tricarbonyl electrocatalysts. This tutorial review summarizes the requirements of IR-SEC cells and details some examples of mechanistic questions addressed in our laboratory using these methods. IR-SEC is presented as a general method that could be adapted by other laboratories to answer questions of interest in the spectroscopic characterization of the full complement of redox states of organometallic complexes and their reactivities. },

	Abstract = { The synthesis, characterization, and ethylene polymerization behavior of a series of iron and cobalt halide complexes, LMXn (M = Fe, X = Cl, n = 2, 3, X = Br, n = 2; M = Co, X = Cl, n = 2), bearing chelating 2,6-bis(imino)pyridyl ligands L [L = 2,6-(ArNCR1)2C5H3N] is reported. X-ray diffraction studies show the geometry at the metal centers to be either distorted square pyramidal or distorted trigonal bipyramidal. Treatment of the complexes LMXn with methylaluminoxane (MAO) leads to highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts converting ethylene to highly linear polyethylene (PE). LFeX2 precatalysts with ketimine ligands (R1 = Me) are approximately an order of magnitude more active than precatalysts with aldimine ligands (R1 = H). Catalyst productivities in the range 3750−20600 g/mmol·h·bar are observed for Fe-based ketimine catalysts, while Co ketimine systems display activities of 450−1740 g/mmol·h·bar. Molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers produced are in the range 14000−611000. Changing reaction conditions also affects productivity and molecular weight; in some systems, a bimodal molecular weight distribution is observed. On the basis of evidence gathered to date, the lower molecular weight fraction is a result of chain transfer to aluminum while the higher molecular weight fraction is produced by a combination of mainly β-H transfer and some chain transfer to aluminum. },

	Abstract = { We report herein the mechanism of the photochemical ligand substitution reactions of a series of fac-[Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(PR3)]+ complexes (1) and the properties of their triplet ligand-field (3LF) excited states. The reason for the photostability of the rhenium complexes [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(py)]+ (3) and [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3Cl] (4) was also investigated. Irradiation of an acetonitrile solution of 1 selectively gave the biscarbonyl complexes cis,trans-[Re(X2bpy)(CO)2(PR3)(CH3CN)]+ (2). Isotope experiments clearly showed that the CO ligand trans to the PR3 ligand was selectively substituted. The photochemical reactions proceeded via a dissociative mechanism from the 3LF excited state. The thermodynamical data for the 3LF excited states of complexes 1 and the corrective nonradiative decay rate constants for the triplet metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT) states were obtained from temperature-dependence data for the emission lifetimes and for the quantum yields of the photochemical reactions and the emission. Comparison of 1 with [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3(py)]+ (3) and [Re(X2bpy)(CO)3Cl] (4) indicated that the 3LF states of some 3- and 4-type complexes are probably accessible from the 3MLCT state even at ambient temperature, but these complexes were stable to irradiation at 365 nm. The photostability of 3 and 4, in contrast to 1, can be explained by differences in the trans effects of the PR3, py, and Cl- ligands. },

@article{morris2009,
	Abstract = { The scientific community now agrees that the rise in atmospheric CO2, the most abundant green house gas, comes from anthropogenic sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. This atmospheric rise in CO2 results in global climate change. Therefore methods for photochemically transforming CO2 into a source of fuel could offer an attractive way to decrease atmospheric concentrations. One way to accomplish this conversion is through the light-driven reduction of carbon dioxide to methane (CH4(g)) or methanol (CH3OH(l)) with electrons and protons derived from water. Existing infrastructure already supports the delivery of natural gas and liquid fuels, which makes these possible CO2 reduction products particularly appealing. This Account focuses on molecular approaches to photochemical CO2 reduction in homogeneous solution. The reduction of CO2 by one electron to form CO2*− is highly unfavorable, having a formal reduction potential of −2.14 V vs SCE. Rapid reduction requires an overpotential of up to 0.6 V, due at least in part to the kinetic restrictions imposed by the structural difference between linear CO2 and bent CO2*−. An alternative and more favorable pathway is to reduce CO2 though proton-assisted multiple-electron transfer. The development of catalysts, redox mediators, or both that efficiently drive these reactions remains an important and active area of research. We divide these reactions into two class types. In Type I photocatalysis, a molecular light absorber and a transition metal catalyst work in concert. We also consider a special case of Type 1 photocatalysis, where a saturated hydrocarbon links the catalyst and the light absorber in a supramolecular compound. In Type II photocatalysis, the light absorber and the catalyst are the same molecule. In these reactions, transition-metal coordination compounds often serve as catalysts because they can absorb a significant portion of the solar spectrum and can promote activation of small molecules. This Account discusses four classes of transition-metal catalysts: (A) metal tetraaza-macrocyclic compounds; (B) supramolecular complexes; (C) metalloporphyrins and related metallomacrocycles; (D) Re(CO)3(bpy)X-based compounds where bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine. Carbon monoxide and formate are the primary CO2 reduction products, and we also propose bicarbonate/carbonate production. For comprehensiveness, we briefly discuss hydrogen formation, a common side reaction that occurs concurrently with CO2 reduction, though the details of that process are beyond the scope of this Account. It is our hope that drawing attention both to current mechanistic hypotheses and to the areas that are poorly understood will stimulate research that could one day provide an efficient solution to this global problem. },

	Abstract = { The donor--acceptor ligands 11-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (dppz-PhNPh2) and 11-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (dppz-PhNMe2), and their rhenium complexes, [Re(CO)3X] (X = Cl--, py, 4-dimethylaminopyridine (dmap)), are reported. Crystal structures of the two ligands were obtained. The optical properties of the ligands and complexes are dominated by intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) transitions from the amine to the dppz moieties with λabs = 463 nm (ε = 13 100 M--1 cm--1) for dppz-PhNMe2 and with λabs = 457 nm (ε = 16 900 M--1 cm--1) for dppz-PhNPh2. This assignment is supported by CAM-B3LYP TD-DFT calculations. These ligands are strongly emissive in organic solvents and, consistent with the ILCT character, show strong solvatochromic behavior. Lippert--Mataga plots of the data are linear and yield Δμ values of 22 D for dppz-PhNPh2 and 20 D for dppz-PhNMe2. The rhenium(I) complexes are less emissive, and it is possible to measure resonance Raman spectra. These data show relative band intensities that are virtually unchanged from λexc = 351 to 532 nm, consistent with a single dominant transition in the visible region. Resonance Raman excitation profiles are solvent sensitive; these data are modeled using wavepacket theory yielding reorganization energies ranging from 1800 cm--1 in toluene to 6900 cm--1 in CH3CN. The excited state electronic absorption and infrared spectroscopy reveal the presence of dark excited states with nanosecond to microsecond lifetimes that are sensitive to the ancillary ligand on the rhenium. These dark states were assigned as phenazine-based 3ILCT states by time-resolved infrared spectroscopy. Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy shows transient features in which Δν(CO) is approximately −7 cm--1, consistent with a ligand-centered excited state. Evidence for two such states is seen in mid-infrared transient spectra. },

The one-electron reduced monomer, Re(dmb)(CO)3S (S = CH3CN or THF), can be prepared either by reductive quenching of the excited states of fac-[Re(dmb)(CO)3(CH3CN)]PF6 or by homolysis of [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2. In the reduced monomer's ground state, the odd electron resides on the dmb ligand rather than on the metal center. Re(dmb)(CO)3S dimerizes slowly in THF, kd = 40 $\pm$ 5 M-1 s-1. This rate constant is much smaller than those of other organometallic radicals which are typically 109 M-1 s-1. The slower rate suggests that the equilibrium between the ligand-centered and metal-centered radicals is very unfavorable (K ≈ 10-4). The reaction of Re(dmb)(CO)3S with CO2 is slow and competes with the dimerization. Photolysis of [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2 in the presence of CO2 produces CO with a 25−50% yield based on [Re]. A CO2 bridged dimer, (CO)3(dmb)Re−CO(O)−Re(dmb)(CO)3 is identified as an intermediate. Both [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO2) and Re(dmb)(CO)3(OC(O)OH) are detected as oxidation products; however, the previously reported formato-rhenium species is not detected. },

	Abstract = { The reaction mechanism of photocatalytic CO2 reduction using rhenium(I) complexes has been investigated by means of a detailed comparison of the photocatalyses of three rhenium(I) complexes, fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3L] (L = SCN- (1-NCS), Cl- (1-Cl), and CN- (1-CN)). The corresponding one-electron-reduced species (OER) of the complexes play two important roles in the reaction:  (a) capturing CO2 after loss of the monodentate ligand (L) and (b) donation of the second electron to CO2 by another OER without loss of L. In the case of 1-NCS, the corresponding OER has both of the capabilities in the photocatalytic reaction, resulting in more efficient CO formation (with a quantum yield of 0.30) than that of 1-Cl (quantum yield of 0.16), for which OER species have too short a lifetime to accumulate during the photocatalytic reaction. On the other hand, 1-CN showed no photocatalytic ability, because the corresponding OER species does not dissociate the CN- ligand. Based on this mechanistic information, the most efficient photocatalytic system was successfully developed using a mixed system with fac-[Re(bpy)(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ and fac-[Re{4,4`-(MeO)2bpy}(CO)3{P(OEt)3}]+, for which the optimized quantum yield for CO formation was 0.59. },

	Abstract = { Photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by rhenium--bipyridyl complexes has been studied through multiple approaches during the past several decades. However, a key reaction intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex, which should govern the activity of CO2 reduction in the photocatalytic cycle, has never been detected in a direct way. In this study on photoreduction of CO2 catalyzed by the 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbpy) complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3Cl] (1), we successfully detect the solvent-coordinated Re complex [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3DMF] (2) as the light-absorbing species to drive photoreduction of CO2. The key intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3(COOH)], is also successfully detected for the first time by means of cold-spray ionization spectrometry (CSI-MS). Mass spectra for a reaction mixture with isotopically labeled 13CO2 provide clear evidence for the incorporation of CO2 into the Re--bipyridyl complex. It is revealed that the starting chloride complex 1 was rapidly transformed into the DMF-coordinated Re complex 2 through the initial cycle of photoreduction of CO2. The observed induction period in the time profile of the CSI-MS signals can well explain the subsequent formation of the CO2-coordinated intermediate from the solvent-coordinated Re--bipyridyl complex. An FTIR study of the reaction mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide clearly shows the appearance of a signal at 1682 cm--1, which shifts to 1647 cm--1 for the 13CO2-labeled counterpart; this is assigned as the CO2-coordinated intermediate, ReII--COOH. Thus, a detailed understanding has now been obtained for the mechanism of the archetypical photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by a Re--bipyridyl complex. },

The anionic complex, [Mn(mesbpy)(CO)3]−, is formed at 300 mV more positive potential than the corresponding state is formed in typical Mn bipyridine catalysts. IR-SEC experiments and chemical reductions with KC8 provide insights into the species leading up to the anionic state, specifically that both the singly reduced and doubly reduced Mn complexes form at the same potential. When formed, the anionic complex binds CO2 with H+, but catalytic activity does not occur until a ∼400 mV more negative potential is present. The Mn complexes show high activity and Faradaic efficiency for CO2 reduction to CO with the addition of weak Br{\o}nsted acids. IR-SEC experiments under CO2/H+ indicate that reduction of a Mn(I)--CO2H catalytic intermediate may be the cause of this unusual ``over-reduction'' required to initiate catalysis. },

The results suggest that the reactions of 1 are governed by complex equilibria involving its ionization to Re(dmbpy)(CO)4+ and OH- or proton transfer to highly basic species. Parallel reaction paths, emanating from Re(dmbpy)(CO)4+, are suggested to account for the formation of CO and formate in the catalytic reactions and support the proposal that 4 is a likely catalytic intermediate in addition to 1.

	Abstract = { The factors determining the electron transfer-induced halide labilization in complexes (α-diimine)Re(CO)3(Hal), Hal = Cl and Br, were systematically studied via EPR and cyclic voltammetry in the presence of substituting ligands such as triphenylphosphine, cyanide, or acetonitrile. The α-diimines employed were the four isomeric bidiazines (bdz) 3,3`-bipyridazine, 2,2`-bipyrazine, and 2,2`- and 4,4`-bipyrimidine and the nonaromatic α-diimines 1,4-di-tert-butyl-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene (dab) and 1,3-di-tert-butylsulfurdiimine (sdi). For comparison, the complexes (L)Re(CO3)Cl, L = 2,2`-bipyridine, 1,4,7,10-tetraazaphenanthrene, and η2-2,2`,2``-terpyridine, and the new cationic species [(bdz)Re(CO)3(CH3CN)]+ were also investigated. In a further experiment, in situ EPR spectroelectrochemistry was employed to study the primary paramagnetic intermediates during the reduction of the prototype compound, (bpy)Re(CO)3Cl, under a CO2 atmosphere. The susceptibility to substitution was found to be dependent not on the redox potential but on the π molecular orbital coefficients at the metal-coordinating nitrogen centers which are reflected by 14N, 185,187Re, and 31P EPR coupling constants. The most labile systems were thus found among the complexes of the small dab and sdi ligands, despite their facile reduction. In contrast, the complexes of these nonaromatic compounds showed an electrochemically reversible one-electron oxidation which, in comparison to the absorption maximum, allowed us to estimate contributions to the reorganization energy of the MLCT excited state in two cases. For the reductive labilization, it is primarily the small but variable and EPR-detectable ligand-to-metal electron (spin) transfer at the metal/ligand interface which determines the extent of activation in 18 + δ valence electron intermediates. },

	Abstract = { Reduction of CO2 to CO was efficiently photocatalyzed by [Re(4,4`-X2bpy)(CO)3PR3]+ (X = H, Me; PR3 = P(OEt)3, P(O-i-Pr)3) in quantum yields of 0.16−0.20. Complexes with CF3 as X or trialkylphosphine as PR3 have much lower photocatalytic ability. One-electron-reduced species of the complexes, which were produced by the photoinduced electron-transfer reaction with triethanolamine, reacted with CO2 in the dark with rate constants of 3.5 × 10-4−1.9 × 10-2 M-1 s-1. The faster the rate of this process, the higher the quantum yield of CO formation. The calculated amount of CO formation, based on the assumption that the process gives CO quantitatively, was similar to the actually observed amount under various conditions. This is consistent with the thermal process being one of the rate-limiting steps in the photocatalyzed reduction of CO2 by the rhenium complexes. },

	Abstract = {A semidirect implementation of the closed-shell MP2 gradient for efficient use on workstation computers is presented. The approach is based on the algorithm proposed by Frisch and coworkers but includes several modifications to reduce disk storage requirements and exploits nonabelian point group symmetry. The performance of the resulting program MPGRAD (BIOSYM Corp., San Diego, CA) is demonstrated in applications to the molecules [AlSi(CH3)3]4 and ferrocene. The largest calculation involved 492 basis functions and was carried out on IBM RS/6000 workstations with memory sizes of 32 and 128 Mb. The ratio of CPU to wallclock time exceeds 90% in all typical applications. {\copyright} 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

@article{tondreau2012,
	Abstract = {Alkene hydrosilylation, the addition of a silicon hydride (Si-H) across a carbon-carbon double bond, is one of the largest-scale industrial applications of homogeneous catalysis and is used in the commercial production of numerous consumer goods. For decades, precious metals, principally compounds of platinum and rhodium, have been used as catalysts for this reaction class. Despite their widespread application, limitations such as high and volatile catalyst costs and competing side reactions have persisted. Here, we report that well-characterized molecular iron coordination compounds promote the selective anti-Markovnikov addition of sterically hindered, tertiary silanes to alkenes under mild conditions. These Earth-abundant base-metal catalysts, coordinated by optimized bis(imino)pyridine ligands, show promise for industrial application.},

	Abstract = {Radiolabeled biomolecules can be used to visualize a variety of diseases through interaction with specific cell receptors. A key step is the introduction of a molecular entity that allows facile labeling with the medically useful radionuclide 99mTc without significant alteration of the structure and function of the biomolecule. One strategy focuses on the design of single amino acid chelates (SAACs){,} novel bifunctional chelators constructed from derivatized amino acids or amino acid analogues. The chelating terminus of the SAAC has been designed for effective coordination to the {99mTc(CO)3}+ core{,} while the other terminus allows incorporation into any position along a peptide sequence or into a variety of biomolecules. In applications to peptidic materials{,} the approach affords significant flexibility in the choice of donors for 99mTc coordination combined with the considerable advantages of routine solid phase synthetic techniques. The methodology allows libraries of peptide-based 99mTc(i) and 186{,}188Re(i) radiopharmaceuticals to prepared using conventional automated peptides synthesis. Other biomolecules{,} including nucleosides{,} carbohydrates{,} folic acid and vitamin B12 are also readily modified using analogous methods. The approach also allows the preparation of isostructural 99mTc and Re complexes for the correlation of in vivo and in vitro imaging studies.},

All new complexes 5-10{,} together with fac-[ReBr(CO)3(tpy)] (3) and fac-[Re(CH3CN)(CO)3(tpy)][PF6] (4){,} are characterized by solution spectroscopy; 3 and 5-9 are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The terpyridine ligands in 3 and 9 are in an unusual [small eta]2-bidentate coordination mode with a pendant pyridyl. Electrochemical studies showed successive metal-based oxidations and a ligand-centered reduction in 5-10. Significant oxidation changes are observed at the Ru(II) and Re(I) centers in 5-10 when compared with their respective monometallic components. Cubic nonlinearities of 5-10 determined by the Z-scan technique at 750 nm reveal two-photon absorption that increases significantly on progression from Ru(II) monomeric precursors to heterobimetallics{,} suggesting NLO enhancement upon heterometallic complex formation.},

	Abstract = {The electrochemical reduction of CO by derivatives of rhenium carbonyl bipyridyl at carbon cathodes in acetonitrile solution is shown to take place by different routes depending on the concentration of water in the system. In the absence of water and CO{,} reduction of -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl](dmbipy = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-dimethyl-2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridyl) leads first to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] followed by elimination of Cl and partial dimerisation of the resultant five-co-ordinate species to give both -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)] and [{Re(dmbipy)(CO)}]. Further reduction gives rise to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)]{,} which is the final product. Cathodic reduction of [Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl] in the presence of CO and absence of water leads to direct attack of CO on -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] to give [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)]{,} which can undergo further reduction to give [Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)(COH)]. By contrast{,} in the presence of HO{,} the complex can be protonated to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)] which is attacked by acetonitrile to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(MeCN)] and CO{,} this latter complex being identified unambiguously by comparison with the species formed in the of the original rhenium complex.},

	Abstract = {Under mild conditions pentacarbonylhalogenorhenium() complexes react with 2{,}2[prime or minute]:6[prime or minute]{,}2[double prime]-terpyridine (terpy) to form stable octahedral tricarbonyl complexes -[ReX(CO)(terpy)](X = Cl{,} Br or I) in which the terpyridine acts as a bidentate chelate ligand. Under more severe reaction conditions -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] can be converted to -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)]. In solution the tricarbonyl complexes are fluxional with the terpyridine oscillating between equivalent bidentate bonding modes. At low temperatures rotation of the unco-ordinated pyridine ring is restricted and in CDCl solution two preferred rotamers exist in approximately equal abundances. Rotational energy barriers have been estimated for the X = Cl and I complexes. The X-ray crystal structure of -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] confirms the bidentate chelate bonding of terpy with a N-Re-N angle of 74.3[degree]. The pendant pyridine ring is inclined at an angle of 52.9[degree] to the adjacent co-ordinated ring and the unco-ordinated nitrogen is directed towards the axial carbonyl and to Br.},

@article{walters2002,
	Abstract = { Stark emission spectroscopy, transient DC photoconductivity (TDCP), and ground-state dipole moment measurements have been used to evaluate charge transfer (CT) within various (X2-bipyridine)ReI(CO)3Cl complexes following 3MLCT excited-state formation. The Stark technique reports on vector differences between ground-state (μg) and excited-state (μe) dipole moments, while TDCP, when combined with independently obtained μg information, reports on scalar differences. For systems featuring collinear, same-signed ground- and excited-state dipole moments, the scalar and vector differences are equivalent. However, for the low symmetry systems studied here, they are distinctly different. The vector difference yields the effective adiabatic one-electron-transfer distance (R12), while the combined vector and scalar data yield information about dipole rotation upon ground-state/excited-state interconversion. For the systems examined, charge transfer distances are substantially smaller than geometric electron-donor/electron-acceptor site separation distances. The measured distances are significantly affected by changes in acceptor ligand substituent composition. Electron-donating substituents decrease CT distances, while electron-withdrawing substituents increase CT distances, as do aromatic substituents that are capable of expanding the bipyridyl ligand (acceptor ligand) π system. The Stark measurements additionally indicate that the CT vector and the transition dipole moment are significantly orthogonal, a consequence of strong polarization of the Re−Cl bond (orthogonal to the metal/acceptor-ligand plane) in the ground electronic state and relaxation of the polarization in the upper state. The ground-state Re−Cl bond polarization is sufficiently large that the overall ground-state scalar dipole moment exceeds the overall excited-state scalar dipole moment, despite transfer of an electron from the metal center to the diimine ligand. This finding provides an explanation for the otherwise puzzling negative solvatochromism exhibited in this family of compounds. Combining TDCP and Stark results, we find that the dipole moment can be rotated in some instances by more than 90$\,^{\circ}$ upon 3MLCT excited-state formation. The degree of rotation or reorientation can be modulated by changing the identity of the acceptor ligand substituents. Reorientational effects are smallest when the compounds feature aromatic substituents capable of spatially extending the π system of the acceptor ligand. },

	Abstract = { We report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical properties of a series of organic receptors and their corresponding ReI and RuII metal complexes as anion probes featuring bis(sulfonamide) interacting sites incorporating highly chromophoric π-conjugated quinoxaline moieties. The interactions with various anions were extensively investigated. These probe molecules are capable of recognizing F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4- with different sensitivities. The probe−anion interactions can be easily visualized via naked-eye colorimetric or luminescent responses. Probe 1 has the weakest acidic sulfonamide N−H protons and therefore simply forms hydrogen-bonding complexes with F-, OAc-, CN-, and H2PO4-. Probe 2 undergoes a stepwise process with the addition of F- and OAc-:  formation of a hydrogen-bound complex followed by sulfonamide N−H deprotonation. Direct sulfonamide N−H deprotonation occurs upon the addition of CN-, while only a hydrogen-bound complex forms with the H2PO4- ion for probe 2 in a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution. Similar probe−anion interactions occur in probe 3 with the addition of F-, CN-, or H2PO4-. However, only a genuine hydrogen-bound complex forms in the presence of the OAc- ion in a DMSO solution of probe 3 because of the subtle difference in the pKa values of sulfonamide N−H protons when probes 2 and 3 are compared. Coordination of probe 1 to a ReI center or probe 2 to a RuII center increases the intrinsic acidity of sulfonamide N−H protons and results in an enhanced sensitivity to anions. },

	Abstract = { The synthesis and characterization of dimeric, aryl-substituted bis(imino)pyridine iron dinitrogen complexes is described. In contrast to reduction with sodium amalgam where bis(chelate) iron compounds were isolated, stirring (ArPDI)FeBr2 or (MeBPDI)FeBr2 (PDI = 2,6-(ArN═CMe)2C5H3N; Ar = 2,6-Et2-C6H3N (EtPDI), 2,6-Me2-C6H3N (MePDI), 2-iPr,6-Me-C6H3N (Me,iPrPDI); MeBPDI = 2,6-(2,6-Me2-C6H3N═CPh)2C5H3N) with sodium naphthalenide resulted in isolation of the desired iron dinitrogen compounds as diamagnetic solids. Two examples, [(EtPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2) and [(MeBPDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The solid state metrical parameters, in combination with infrared and M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopic data, establish ferrous compounds with doubly reduced chelates. Each new bis(imino)pyridine iron dinitrogen compound was screened for the catalytic hydrogenation of ethyl-3-methylbut-2-enoate, and the compound bearing the smallest aryl substituent, [(MePDI)Fe(N2)]2(μ2-N2), offers significant improvement over the original (iPrPDI)Fe(N2)2 pre-catalyst and is one of the most active iron pre-catalysts known. },

The complexes 3a,b,d, and 5c and the isomers of 8e showed high catalytic activity (TOFs ranging from 22 to 4870 h--1, TONs up to 24000) in the hydrogenation of monosubstituted olefins. For 8e(down) and 8e(up) a remarkable functional group tolerance and catalyst stability were noticed. Kinetic experiments revealed kobs to be first order in c(cat) and c(H2) and zeroth order in c(olefin). Mechanistic studies and DFT calculations suggest the catalysis to proceed along an Osborn-type catalytic cycle with olefin before H2 addition. The unsaturated key intermediates [ReBrH(NO)(P∩P)] (2a--e) could be intercepted with MeCN as [ReBrH(MeCN)(NO)(P∩P)] (10a--d) complexes or isolated as dimeric μ2-(H)2 complexes [{ReBr(μ2-H)(NO)(P∩P)}2] (9b and 9e). Variation of the bidentate ligand demonstrated a crucial influence of the (large)-bite-angle on the catalytic performance and reactivity of 3a,b,d, 5c, and 8e. },

	Abstract = {The development of rhenium(I) chemistry has been restricted by the limited structural and electronic variability of the common pseudo-octahedral products fac-[ReX(CO)3L2] (L2=α-diimine). We address this constraint by first preparing the bidentate bis(imino)pyridine complexes [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)3X] (X=Cl 2, Br 3), which were characterized by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic means, and then converting these species into tridentate pincer ligand compounds, [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2X] (X=Cl 4, Br 5). This transformation was performed in the solid-state by controlled heating of 2 or 3 above 200 $\,^{\circ}$C in a tube furnace under a flow of nitrogen gas, giving excellent yields (≥95 %). Compounds 4 and 5 define a new coordination environment for rhenium(I) carbonyl chemistry where the metal center is supported by a planar, tridentate pincer-coordinated bis(imino)pyridine ligand. The basic photophysical features of these compounds show significant elaboration in both number and intensity of the d--π* transitions observed in the UV/Vis spec tra relative to the bidentate starting materials, and these spectra were analyzed using time-dependent DFT computations. The redox nature of the bis(imino)pyridine ligand in compounds 2 and 4 was examined by electrochemical analysis, which showed two ligand reduction events and demonstrated that the ligand reduction shifts to a more positive potential when going from bidentate 2 to tridentate 4 (+160 mV for the first reduction step and +90 mV for the second). These observations indicate an increase in electrostatic stabilization of the reduced ligand in the tridentate conformation. Elaboration on this synthetic methodology documented its generality through the preparation of the pseudo-octahedral rhenium(I) triflate complex [(2,6-{2,6-Me2C6H3NCPh}2C5H3N)Re(CO)2OTf] (7, 93 % yield).},

The appearance of weak hydrogen bond networks in the crystal lattice of [Re(ephen)(CO)3Cl] and ephen are discussed. Two different isomers of [Re(ephen)(CO)3Cl] were identified by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Coincidental resonances were differentiated for these complexes by temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopy. Recrystallisation of the crude material allowed the separation of the two isomers. The spectroscopic data permitted the calculation of radiative and nonradiative luminescence rate constants which are consistent with the energy gap law. ({\copyright} Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	Abstract = {Two series of complexes [MX(diimine)(CO)3] (M = Tc, Re) have been prepared, fully characterised and investigated for their ability to act as photocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to CO. One series consists of complexes with different aromatic diimine ligands while keeping X = Br-- constant. The second series describes complexes with diimine = 2,2-bipyridine and variations in the anionic ligand X--. Although numerous complexes of this type have been prepared and investigated before, a systematic study of their photocatalytic activity has not yet been carried out. Electrochemical and spectroscopic characterisation of these complexes has been performed with the objective of better understanding their respective activity in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.Despite various modifications, catalytic activity is retainedfor all compounds exhibiting fluorescence, including [99TcCl(bipy)(CO)3], whereas nonfluorescing compounds did not convert CO2 to CO. The correlation of catalytic activity and spectroscopic or electrochemical properties such as absorption or emission wavelengths, redox potentials or Stern--Volmer constants for the reductive quenching of the excited complexes is difficult. Nevertheless, the study emphasises the possibility to obtain [ReX(CO)3(diimine)] complexes with a wide range of physicochemical properties by ligand variations and the great potential of compounds of this class of complexes as inorganic photosensitisers.

	Abstract = {An analysis of the conjugative possibilities of dienes carrying two terminal heteroatom donors shows some generalizations of these as possible redox-active (redox ``noninnocent'') ligands. If the two E=C functionalities (E = O,S, NR, CHR) are connected by an odd number of sp2-hybridized atoms, full conjugation between the two terminal E donors is not possible, a situation which is found both in 2,6-bis(imino)pyridine (BIMPY) and beta-diketiminate ligands; the character of their redox noninnocence is thus altered, compared to 1,4-diheterodienes. Some insight into the BIMPY ligand comes from the analog where one imino arm is absent. The traditional stereochemical relationships which govern conjugation in arenes are analyzed for their implications for different bis(imino)pyridine isomers, and also for 2,6-dipyrimidyl- and dipyridazinyl-pyridines, as generalizations of the classic terpyridyl ligands. Factors which favor oxidized vs. reduced ligand forms are discussed.},

@article{hawecker1986,
	Abstract = {[fac-Re(bpy) (CO)3Cl] (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) is an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the selective and sustained photochemical or electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. A quantum yield of 14% and a faradic efficiency of 98% were measured in the presence of excess Cl− ions. The photochemical process took place under visible-light irradiation and consumed a tertiary amine as electron donor. A formato-rhenium complex was isolated in the absence of excess Cl− ions. Substitution by Cl− ion generated free formate, but no CO was detected. Luminescence measurements showed that the tertiary amine quenches the metal-to-ligand charge-transfer excited state of the rhenium complex via a reductive mechanism, with a rate constant of 3.4 × 107M−1S−1. The 19e-complex [Re(bpy) (CO)3X]− produced either photochemically or electrochemically appears to be the active precursor in the CO-generation process. Detailed spectroscopic studies on 13C-enriched carbonyl-rhenium and formato-rhenium complexes derived from 13C-enriched CO2 were performed in order to confirm the origin of the products and to study the exchange of the ligands. A mechanism for the present CO2 photoreduction process is presented; it involves separate pathways for CO and formate generation, in which the [Re(bpy) (CO)3X] complex plays the role of both the photoactive and the catalytic center.},
