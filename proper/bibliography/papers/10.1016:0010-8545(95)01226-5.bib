abstract = "The ability of carbon dioxide to act as a ligand in transition metal complexes is now well documented and several coordination modes of \{CO2\} have been described. Spectroscopic methodologies allowing the characterization of \{CO2\} complexes even if crystallographic data are not available have now been developed. The binding of \{CO2\} to a metal centre generally leads to “activation” of the \{CO2\} molecule, and various reactions of coordinated \{CO2\} are known. However, activation by coordination is not a necessary prerequisite for catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide to useful chemicals. Recent theoretical and experimental work suggests that only weak interactions between \{CO2\} and the active metal centre are sufficient to bring about catalytic reactions involving the formal insertion of \{CO2\} in an MX bond as a key step.
