abstract  ="A series of new derivatives of the di(2-pyridyl)amine ligand has been prepared{,} having the general formula (py)2NR{,} where R is one of a wide range of groups including naphthyl{,} pyrenyl{,} benzo-18-crown-6{,} pyrenyl{,} oxazolyl and bromo-biphenyl. All ligands are luminescent{,} with emission maxima between 370 and 520 nm{,} and with quantum yields in fluid solution of up to 0.74. Reaction of these ligands with Re(CO)5Cl afforded complexes of the type [Re(CO)3ClL] in which the di(2-pyridyl)amine ligand binds as an N{,}N-bidentate chelate via the two pyridyl units; five such complexes have been structurally characterised. With one exception the complexes are essentially non-luminescent{,} which we ascribe to the energetic availability of metal-based d-d excited states which can quench any MLCT or ligand-centred excited states. The exception is [Re(CO)3Cl(tppd)] [where tppd = N{,}N{,}N[prime or minute]{,}N[prime or minute]-tetrakis(2-pyridyl)-p-phenylenediamine] in which one di(2-pyridyl)amine site is occupied by a {Re(CO)3Cl} unit but the other is vacant; this luminesces in fluid solution at 516 nm ([curly or open phi] = 0.04{,} [small tau] = 42 ns)."}
