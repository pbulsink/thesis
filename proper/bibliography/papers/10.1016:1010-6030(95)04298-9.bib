abstract = "[Re(bpy) (CO)3{P(OEt)3}]+ (1+) (bpy, 2,2′-bipyridine) is the most efficient homogeneous photocatalyst for the selective reduction of \{CO2\} to \{CO\} reported to date. Both the quantum yield and turnover number of the photocatalytic reaction are strongly dependent on the irradiation light intensity and wavelength because of the unusual stability of the one-electron-reduced species [Re(bpy.−) (CO)3{P(OEt)3}] (1).
