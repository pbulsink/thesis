abstract = {Rhenium(I) carbonyl complexes carrying substituted bis(arylimino)acenaphthene ligands (BIAN-R) have been tested as potential catalysts for the two-electron reduction of carbon dioxide. Cyclic voltammetric studies as well as controlled potential electrolysis experiments were performed using CO2-saturated solutions of the complexes in acetonitrile and acetonitrile–water mixtures. Faradaic efficiencies of more than 30 % have been determined for the electrocatalytic production of CO. The effects of ligand substitution patterns and water content of the reaction medium on the catalytic performance of the new catalysts are discussed.},
