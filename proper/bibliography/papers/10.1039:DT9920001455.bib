abstract  ="The electrochemical reduction of CO by derivatives of rhenium carbonyl bipyridyl at carbon cathodes in acetonitrile solution is shown to take place by different routes depending on the concentration of water in the system. In the absence of water and CO{,} reduction of -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl](dmbipy = 4{,}4[prime or minute]-dimethyl-2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridyl) leads first to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] followed by elimination of Cl and partial dimerisation of the resultant five-co-ordinate species to give both -[Re(dmbipy)(CO)] and [{Re(dmbipy)(CO)}]. Further reduction gives rise to -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)]{,} which is the final product. Cathodic reduction of [Re(dmbipy)(CO)Cl] in the presence of CO and absence of water leads to direct attack of CO on -[Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)Cl] to give [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)]{,} which can undergo further reduction to give [Re(dmbipy[radical dot])(CO)(COH)]. By contrast{,} in the presence of HO{,} the complex can be protonated to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(COH)] which is attacked by acetonitrile to yield [Re(dmbipy)(CO)(MeCN)] and CO{,} this latter complex being identified unambiguously by comparison with the species formed in the of the original rhenium complex."}
