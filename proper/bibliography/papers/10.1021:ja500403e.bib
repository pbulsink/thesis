abstract = { Photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by rhenium–bipyridyl complexes has been studied through multiple approaches during the past several decades. However, a key reaction intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re–bipyridyl complex, which should govern the activity of CO2 reduction in the photocatalytic cycle, has never been detected in a direct way. In this study on photoreduction of CO2 catalyzed by the 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbpy) complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3Cl] (1), we successfully detect the solvent-coordinated Re complex [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3DMF] (2) as the light-absorbing species to drive photoreduction of CO2. The key intermediate, the CO2-coordinated Re–bipyridyl complex, [Re(dmbpy)(CO)3(COOH)], is also successfully detected for the first time by means of cold-spray ionization spectrometry (CSI-MS). Mass spectra for a reaction mixture with isotopically labeled 13CO2 provide clear evidence for the incorporation of CO2 into the Re–bipyridyl complex. It is revealed that the starting chloride complex 1 was rapidly transformed into the DMF-coordinated Re complex 2 through the initial cycle of photoreduction of CO2. The observed induction period in the time profile of the CSI-MS signals can well explain the subsequent formation of the CO2-coordinated intermediate from the solvent-coordinated Re–bipyridyl complex. An FTIR study of the reaction mixture in dimethyl sulfoxide clearly shows the appearance of a signal at 1682 cm–1, which shifts to 1647 cm–1 for the 13CO2-labeled counterpart; this is assigned as the CO2-coordinated intermediate, ReII–COOH. Thus, a detailed understanding has now been obtained for the mechanism of the archetypical photochemical CO2 reduction sensitized by a Re–bipyridyl complex. }
