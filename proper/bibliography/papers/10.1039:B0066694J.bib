abstract  ="The synthesis and luminescence behaviour of carbon-rich rhenium(i) complexes containing rigid-rod sp carbon chains are reported. Perturbation of the luminescence properties through structural variation of the ancillary ligands and the carbon chain length has been achieved. Utilization of the alkynylrhenium(i) system for mixed-metal complex formation is also described."}
