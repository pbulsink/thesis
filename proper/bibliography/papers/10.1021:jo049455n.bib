abstract = { The addition of carboxylic acids to terminal alkynes is efficiently catalyzed by the early transition-metal complex Re(CO)5Br in toluene or n-heptane at 110 °C in an air atmosphere, affording the anti-Markovnikov adducts in good yields with high selectivity. In most cases, the reactions afford unusual Z-adduct predominantly. When n-heptane was used as solvent, Re(CO)5Br can be partly recovered from the reaction mixture. }
