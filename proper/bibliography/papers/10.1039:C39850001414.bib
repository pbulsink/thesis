abstract  ="The cyclic voltammetry of -Re(bpy)(CO)Cl (bpy = 2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridine) and of the intermediate complexes formed by bulk electrolysis in MeCN solution in the presence and absence of CO has been interpreted in terms of two different electrocatalytic pathways for the reduction of CO to Co{,} one involving an initial one-electron reduction and the other an initial two-electron reduction."}
