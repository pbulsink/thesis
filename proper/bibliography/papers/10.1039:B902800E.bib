abstract  ="A series of heterobimetallic complexes{,} [RuCp(C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]Cpy-4)(P-P)][Re(CO)3(N-N)]+ (P-P = dppf{,} N-N = bpy 5{,} Me2bpy 6{,} tBu2bpy 7{,} phen 8{,} tpy 9; P-P = 2PPh3{,} N-N = bpy 10) have been obtained from Lewis addition between the metalloligands [RuCp(C[triple bond{,} length as m-dash]Cpy-4)(P-P)] (P-P = dppf 1; 2PPh32) and solvent-stabilised fac-[Re(CH3CN)(CO)3(N-N)]+. All new complexes 5-10{,} together with fac-[ReBr(CO)3(tpy)] (3) and fac-[Re(CH3CN)(CO)3(tpy)][PF6] (4){,} are characterized by solution spectroscopy; 3 and 5-9 are also characterized by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. The terpyridine ligands in 3 and 9 are in an unusual [small eta]2-bidentate coordination mode with a pendant pyridyl. Electrochemical studies showed successive metal-based oxidations and a ligand-centered reduction in 5-10. Significant oxidation changes are observed at the Ru(II) and Re(I) centers in 5-10 when compared with their respective monometallic components. Cubic nonlinearities of 5-10 determined by the Z-scan technique at 750 nm reveal two-photon absorption that increases significantly on progression from Ru(II) monomeric precursors to heterobimetallics{,} suggesting NLO enhancement upon heterometallic complex formation."}
