abstract  ="The 3-chloromethylpyridyl bipyridine fac tricarbonyl rhenium cation is a thiol-reactive luminescent agent with a long luminescence lifetime and large Stokes shift that is demonstrated by co-localisation studies to accumulate in mitochondria. This represents the first application of a 3MLCT luminescent agent for the specific targeting of a biological entity in imaging."}
