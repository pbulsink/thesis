abstract = "Rhenium(I) and ruthenium(II) complexes have been successfully used for photochemical \{CO2\} reduction to \{CO\} or formate. However, a typical turnover frequency for such reactions is &lt;20&#xa0;h−1 and the formation of reduced species beyond \{CO\} or formate is very limited. In the case of the rhenium(I) bipyridyl tricarbonyl system, the key intermediate has been shown to decay with a first-order dependence on [CO2] to produce CO, which is the rate-determining step. The limited concentration of dissolved \{CO2\} in organic solvents results in extremely slow \{CO2\} reduction. To improve the reaction rate, we prepared new CO2-soluble rhenium(I) bipyridine complexes bearing fluorinated alkyl ligands and investigated their photophysical properties in \{CH3CN\} and supercritical CO2. We also investigated the properties of a metal complex with an NAD+ model ligand, [Ru(bpy)2(pbn)]2+ (bpy&#xa0;=&#xa0;2,2′-bipyridine, pbn&#xa0;=&#xa0;2-(2-pyridyl)-benzo[b]-1,5-naphthyridine), and prepared the corresponding NADH-like complex [Ru(bpy)2(pbnHH)]2+ upon \{MLCT\} excitation followed by reductive quenching. This species can be used as a renewable hydride donor. The electrochemical and photochemical properties, and the reactivity of these species toward \{CO2\} reduction were investigated. "
