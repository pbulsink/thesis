abstract  ="Gaussian basis sets of quadruple zeta valence quality for Rb-Rn are presented{,} as well as bases of split valence and triple zeta valence quality for H-Rn. The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements-except lanthanides-in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies{,} dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree-Fock{,} density functional theory and correlated methods{,} for which we had chosen Moller-Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results."}
