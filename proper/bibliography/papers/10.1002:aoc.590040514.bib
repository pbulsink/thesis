abstract = {The reactions of [Re(CO)5Cl] with the ligands tpy (2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine), py3N {tris(2-pyridyl)-amine}, py3CH {tris(2-pyridyl)methane}, and py3P {tris(2-pyridyl)phosphine} in toluene solution realize compounds with the general formulation [Re(ligand)(CO)3Cl] in which the tripyridyl ligands are bidentate. X-ray structural determinations of fac-[Re(typ)(CO)3Cl].H2O and fac-[Re(py3N)(CO)3Cl] confirm these assignments. [Re(tpy)(CO)3Cl].H2O (C18H13ClN3O4Re) is monoclinic, space group P21/n, with cell dimensions a = 7.432(2) Å, b = 17.016(4) Å, c = 14.466(2) Å, β = 93.51(2)°, and Z = 4; full-matrix least-squares refinement on 2435 reflections with I ⩾ 2.5σ(I) converged to a final R = 0.028 and Rw = 0.029. [Re(py3N)(CO)3Cl] (C18H12ClN4O3Re) is triclinic, space group P1 with cell dimensions a = 13.761(2) Å, b = 14.636(6)Å, c = 11.110(2) Å, α = 110.70(2)°, β = 102.45(2)°, γ = 107.48(2)°, and Z = 4; full-matrix least-squares refinement on 3459 reflections with I ⩾ 2.5σ(I) converged to a final R = 0.038 and Rw = 0.039. If the synthetic procedure is undertaken under irradiation by visible light, for the ligand py3N a species [Re(py3N)(CO)2Cl] (characterized by infrared spectroscopy and conductance measurements) is also formed, in which the ligand py3N is tridentate. No analogous tridentate species is formed with the ligands tpy or py3P, although there is evidence that it also forms for py3CH.},
