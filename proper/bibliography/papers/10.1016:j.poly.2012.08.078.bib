abstract = "The reaction of [Re(CO)5X] (X&#xa0;=&#xa0;Cl, Br) with a series of six potentially multidentate nitrogen donor ligands (L1–L6) was studied. The ligands L1–L5 are coordinated bidentately in the neutral complexes of the type fac-[Re(CO)3X(L)] (1–5). The complex salt [Re(CO)3(L6)]Br (6) was formed by the reaction of [Re(CO)5Br] with 2-aminobenzaldehyde (aba), in which the tridentate ligand \{L6\} was formed by the Schiff base condensation of three aba molecules. The crystal structures for complexes 1–6 were determined by X-ray single crystal diffraction. UV–Vis absorption spectra of the complexes show the intraligand and \{MLCT\} transitions. Electrochemical behaviour of the complexes was studied with cyclic voltammetry. "
