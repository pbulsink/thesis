abstract = { The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to liquid fuels has tremendous positive impacts on atomospheric carbon balance and help to reduce global warming issues. This paper reviewed current knowledge of electrochemical CO2 reduction to small organic molecule fuels on metal catalysts and gas-phase CO2 reduction techniques based on gas diffusion electrode and solid polymer electrolyte. Future research and development needs in this area were also discussed. }
