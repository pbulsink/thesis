abstract  ="B3LYP is by far the most popular density functional in chemistry. Nevertheless{,} there is growing evidence{,} showing that B3LYP (1) degrades as the system becomes larger{,} (2) underestimates reaction barrier heights{,} (3) yields too low bond dissociation enthalpies{,} (4) gives improper isomer energy differences{,} and (5) fails to bind van der Waals systems{,} etc."}
