abstract = { Bidentate phosphonate monoesters are analogues of popular dicarboxylate linkers in MOFs, but with an alkoxy tether close to the coordinating site. Herein, we report 3-D MOF materials based upon phosphonate monoester linkers. Cu(1,4-benzenediphosphonate bis(monoalkyl ester), CuBDPR, with an ethyl tether is nonporous; however, the methyl tether generates an isomorphous framework that is porous and captures CO2 with a high isosteric heat of adsorption of 45 kJ molâ€“1. Computational modeling reveals that the CO2 uptake is extremely sensitive both to the flexing of the structure and to the orientation of the alkyl tether. }
