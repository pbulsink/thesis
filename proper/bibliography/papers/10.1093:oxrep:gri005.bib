abstract ={Comparisons of resource assessments suggest that sufficient renewable energy resources are available to allow for large-scale deployment of renewable energy technologies. Economic analysis identifies barriers to the adoption of renewable energy sources resulting from (i) market structure, (ii) competition in an uneven playing field, and (iii) various non-marketplace barriers. However, even if these barriers are removed, the problem of ‘technology lock-out’ remains. The key policy response is strategic deployment coupled with increased R&D support to accelerate the pace of improvement through market experience. This paper suggests significant contributions from various technologies are possible, but does not assess their optimal or maximal market share.},
