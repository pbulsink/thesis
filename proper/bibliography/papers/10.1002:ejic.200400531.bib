abstract = {The structural and spectroscopic characterisations of fac-[Re(phen)(CO)3Cl] (1) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline), fac-[Re(ephen)(CO)3Cl] (3) [ephen = 5,6-epoxy-1,10-phenanthroline (2)] and ephen are reported. The appearance of weak hydrogen bond networks in the crystal lattice of [Re(ephen)(CO)3Cl] and ephen are discussed. Two different isomers of [Re(ephen)(CO)3Cl] were identified by IR and NMR spectroscopy. Coincidental resonances were differentiated for these complexes by temperature-dependent NMR spectroscopy. Recrystallisation of the crude material allowed the separation of the two isomers. The spectroscopic data permitted the calculation of radiative and nonradiative luminescence rate constants which are consistent with the energy gap law. (© Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.
