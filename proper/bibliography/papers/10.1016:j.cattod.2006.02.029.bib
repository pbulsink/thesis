abstract = "Utilization of carbon dioxide (CO2) has become an important global issue due to the significant and continuous rise in atmospheric \{CO2\} concentrations, accelerated growth in the consumption of carbon-based energy worldwide, depletion of carbon-based energy resources, and low efficiency in current energy systems. The barriers for \{CO2\} utilization include: (1) costs of \{CO2\} capture, separation, purification, and transportation to user site; (2) energy requirements of \{CO2\} chemical conversion (plus source and cost of co-reactants); (3) market size limitations, little investment-incentives and lack of industrial commitments for enhancing CO2-based chemicals; and (4) the lack of socio-economical driving forces. The strategic objectives may include: (1) use \{CO2\} for environmentally-benign physical and chemical processing that adds value to the process; (2) use \{CO2\} to produce industrially useful chemicals and materials that adds value to the products; (3) use \{CO2\} as a beneficial fluid for processing or as a medium for energy recovery and emission reduction; and (4) use \{CO2\} recycling involving renewable sources of energy to conserve carbon resources for sustainable development. The approaches for enhancing \{CO2\} utilization may include one or more of the following: (1) for applications that do not require pure CO2, develop effective processes for using the CO2-concentrated flue gas from industrial plants or CO2-rich resources without \{CO2\} separation; (2) for applications that need pure CO2, develop more efficient and less-energy intensive processes for separation of \{CO2\} selectively without the negative impacts of co-existing gases such as H2O, O2, and N2; (3) replace a hazardous or less-effective substance in existing processes with \{CO2\} as an alternate medium or solvent or co-reactant or a combination of them; (4) make use of \{CO2\} based on the unique physical properties as supercritical fluid or as either solvent or anti-solvent; (5) use \{CO2\} based on the unique chemical properties for \{CO2\} to be incorporated with high ‘atom efficiency’ such as carboxylation and carbonate synthesis; (6) produce useful chemicals and materials using \{CO2\} as a reactant or feedstock; (7) use \{CO2\} for energy recovery while reducing its emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration; (8) recycle \{CO2\} as C-source for chemicals and fuels using renewable sources of energy; and (9) convert \{CO2\} under either bio-chemical or geologic-formation conditions into “new fossil” energies. Several cases are discussed in more detail. The first example is tri-reforming of methane versus the well-known \{CO2\} reforming over transition metal catalysts such as supported Ni catalysts. Using \{CO2\} along with \{H2O\} and \{O2\} in flue gases of power plants without separation, tri-reforming is a synergetic combination of \{CO2\} reforming, steam reforming and partial oxidation and it can eliminate carbon deposition problem and produces syngas with desired H2/CO ratios for industrial applications. The second example is a \{CO2\} “molecular basket” as CO2-selective high-capacity adsorbent which was developed using mesoporous molecular sieve MCM-41 and polyethylenimine (PEI). The MCM41-PEI adsorbent has higher adsorption capacity than either \{PEI\} or MCM-41 alone and can be used as highly CO2-selective adsorbent for gas mixtures without the pre-removal of moisture because it even enhances \{CO2\} adsorption capacity. The third example is synthesis of dimethyl carbonate using \{CO2\} and methanol, which demonstrates the environmental benefit of avoiding toxic phosgene and a processing advantage. The fourth example is the application of supercritical \{CO2\} for extraction and for chemical processing where \{CO2\} is either a solvent or a co-reactant, or both. The \{CO2\} utilization contributes to enhancing sustainability, since various chemicals, materials, and fuels can be synthesized using CO2, which should be a sustainable way in the long term when renewable sources of energy are used as energy input.
