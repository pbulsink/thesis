abstract = "This review will focus on three aspects of spectroscopic research. The first is the theoretical explanation of Adamson's rules in terms of ligand-field theory. The explanation made the connections between electronic spectroscopy and photochemical activity. The second is the development of new methods of relating bonding changes deduced from spectroscopy with the excited-state distortions of a molecule (i.e. the actual bond lengths and bond angles of the molecule in the excited state). The time-dependent theory of electronic and resonance Raman spectroscopy focuses on the dynamics that occur after absorption of a photon, and provides a new point of view of the time evolution of the molecule. The final aspect is the dynamics of molecules when multiple coupled excited electronic states and multiple normal coordinates are involved. Amplitude transfer between states leads to intensity borrowing, intersystem crossing, and interference dips that can be measured spectroscopically. This review emphasizes the interplay between theory and experiment and between the static and dynamic views of the properties of excited electronic states of metal-containing molecules. "
