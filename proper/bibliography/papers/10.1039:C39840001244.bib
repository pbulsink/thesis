abstract  ="The reactive organometallic trifluoromethanesulphonato (CFSO) complex -Re(bpy)(CO)CFSO(bpy = 2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridine) has neen used as a basis for the synthesis of the series of complexes -Re(bpy)(CO)X (X = H{,} OCH{,} and OCOH) all of which are involved in the reduction of CO; the hydrido complex has been found to undergo a slow thermal reaction with CO to give the formato complex{,} a reaction which is greatly enhanced by visible light."}
