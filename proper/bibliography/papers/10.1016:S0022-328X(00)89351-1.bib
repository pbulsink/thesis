abstract = "The reaction of the rhenium tetracarbonyl metallo-acetylacetone molecule, cis-(OC)4Re[C(CH3)O⋰H⋰O(CH3)C], with hydrazine, methylhydrazine and phenylhydrazine affords the corresponding acetyl-amine complexes, cis-(OC)4- Re(COCH3)(NH2R), where R = H, CH3, or C6H5, and acetonitrile. The reactions were followed by proton \{NMR\} at 36°C. The half-lilfe of the reaction with phenylhydrazine was 8.67 minutes while the other two hydrazines gave complete reaction within 30 seconds. The X-ray molecular structure determination of the acetyl-aniline complex is reported. "
