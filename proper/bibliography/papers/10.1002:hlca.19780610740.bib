abstract = {Irradiation by visible light of a neutral aqueous solution containing Ru (bipy) 32+ as a sensitizer, methylviologen (MV+2) as an electron acceptor and triethanolamine or cysteine as an electron donor leads to the formation of stable methylviologen radical cation (MV+). The kinetics and mechanism of the photoinduced reactions occurring in such a system were explored by laser photolysis technique. In the presence of Adams catalyst MV+ is reoxidized by water under simultaneous evolution of hydrogen. Optimum conditions for the water reduction under continuous illumination are elaborated and implications for an energy conversion system discussed.},
