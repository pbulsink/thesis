abstract ={As organometallic chemists have delved into the chemistry of rhenium, an amazing variety of unusual stable organorhenium compounds have been synthesized and novel reaction pathways have been uncovered. The broad range of stable organorhenium compounds can be traced to the availability of oxidation states from -III to VII and to the high strength of bonds to rhenium. New types of reaction mechanism are seen in response to the reluctance of rhenium to form coordinatively unsaturated complexes.},
