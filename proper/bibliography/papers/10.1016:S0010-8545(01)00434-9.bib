abstract = "A series of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ (L=CO2, C(O)OH, CO, CHO, CH2OH, CH3, and C(O)CH3; n=0, 1, 2) were prepared and their molecular structures determined by X-ray analyses. These complexes are reasonable models of reaction intermediates in the multi-electron reduction of \{CO2\} catalyzed by metal complexes, since reductive cleavage of the RuL bonds of the complexes in protic media affords HCOOH, CO, HCHO, CH3OH, and \{CH4\} as two-, four-, six- and eight-electron reduction products of CO2. Thermodynamically, the free energy required in the reduction of \{CO2\} progressively decreases with an increase of the number of electrons participating in the reduction of CO2. The RuL bond character of the series of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ was assessed by the ν(RuL) bands and the RuL bond distances from the viewpoint of elucidation of a correlation between free energy changes in the multi-electron reduction of \{CO2\} catalyzed by metal complexes and the metalcarbon bond strength of each intermediate. The rutheniumcarbon bond distance of [Ru(bpy)2(CO)L]n+ largely depends on the hybrid orbital of the carbon atom bonded to ruthenium and lengthens in the order RuCsp&lt;RuCsp2&lt;RuCsp3. An unusual shift of the ν(RuL) bands to higher wavenumber with decrease of the RuL bond distances was discussed in terms of σ- and π-character of the rutheniumcarbon bonds. "
