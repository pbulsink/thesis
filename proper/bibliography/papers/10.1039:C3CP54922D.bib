abstract  ="The photoreduction of the bis(2-phenylpyridinato-)(2{,}2[prime or minute]-bipyridine)iridium(iii) ion ([Ir(ppy)2(bpy)]+){,} used as a photosensitizer in photocatalytic water splitting{,} by triethylamine was studied by means of UV/VIS{,} XANES{,} and EPR spectroscopies{,} supported by theoretical calculations at density functional theory (DFT) and complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF/CASPT2) levels. The combination of these methods suggests a predominant bpy localization of the spin-density of the unpaired electron with notable delocalization to the Ir center. This is particularly evident from EPR and theoretical results and leads to broad EPR lines and a large anisotropy of the g-factor."}
