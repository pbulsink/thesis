abstract  ="Under mild conditions pentacarbonylhalogenorhenium() complexes react with 2{,}2[prime or minute]:6[prime or minute]{,}2[double prime]-terpyridine (terpy) to form stable octahedral tricarbonyl complexes -[ReX(CO)(terpy)](X = Cl{,} Br or I) in which the terpyridine acts as a bidentate chelate ligand. Under more severe reaction conditions -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] can be converted to -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)]. In solution the tricarbonyl complexes are fluxional with the terpyridine oscillating between equivalent bidentate bonding modes. At low temperatures rotation of the unco-ordinated pyridine ring is restricted and in CDCl solution two preferred rotamers exist in approximately equal abundances. Rotational energy barriers have been estimated for the X = Cl and I complexes. The X-ray crystal structure of -[ReBr(CO)(terpy)] confirms the bidentate chelate bonding of terpy with a N-Re-N angle of 74.3[degree]. The pendant pyridine ring is inclined at an angle of 52.9[degree] to the adjacent co-ordinated ring and the unco-ordinated nitrogen is directed towards the axial carbonyl and to Br."}
