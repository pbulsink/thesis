\section{Introduction}
%======================================================================

Within three years of the appearance of the originally reported bipyridine rhenium (I) catalyst, experimental studies on the mechanism of the photocatalytic reduction of \ce{CO2} were available in the literature\autocite{hawecker1986}. Studies continue on the mechanism up to the present day\autocite{johnson1996, koike2002, takeda2008, smieja2012, machan2014, kou2014}, utilizing new investigative techniques as they become available to elucidate transition states and transient intermediates \textit{in situ}. 

Investigation includes the use of \gls{ac.dft} methods to elucidate geometries of intermediates and transition states for of the multi-step cycle. Transition metal catalysis is a non-trivial problem computationally, particularly when considering a metal from the lower period. These elements contain a large amount of electrons, many of which can be involved in non-covalent interactions with the ligands and catalyzed products. Solving for this complex system becomes non-trivial and computationally expensive. For this reason, no overview of the mechanism as investigated by \gls{ac.dft} methods has ever been made available in the literature. 

%======================================================================
\section{Mechanism Pathways}
%======================================================================

Prior work in the literature has proposed three general mechanistic pathways for the photoreduction of \ce{CO2}. In general, as seen in \autoref{fig.threepath}, these pathways result in the formation of \ce{CO} and \ce{H2O}, formate (\ce{HCO2-}), or carbonate (\ce{CO3H-}) anions. The formation of carbonate proceeds via the formation of a catalyst dimer over a molecule of \ce{CO2}, with the insertion of a second molecule of \ce{CO2} to produce the carbonate and a molecule of \ce{CO}. Production of formate occurs via insertion of \ce{CO2} to a rhenium hydride bond. The formation of \ce{CO} without carbonate or formate by-products occurs via the coordination of \ce{CO2} to an open site on the metal, followed by a double proton addition and the release of a molecule of \ce{H2O} prior to the loss of one of the four carbonyl groups to open up the axial site for halide re-coordination. This is essentially the \gls{ac.rwgsr}, wherein protons are made available from decomposition of the sacrificial amine instead of from decomposition of \ce{H2}\autocite{kalyanasundaram1978}. These three mechanistic pathways will be referred to as the `carbonate' mechanism, the `formate' mechanism, and the `water-gas shift' mechanism, respectively.

\caption[Overview of mechanistic pathways]{An overview of the mechanistic pathways of photochemical \ce{CO2} reduction. Catalyst is shown in blue, and the excimer species in red}
\label{fig.threepath}
\end{figure} 

Each of the mechanistic pathways identified above in \autoref{fig.threepath} was studied, using \gls{ac.dft} methods. Structures (using 2,2'-bipyridine as the bidentate ligand, and triethylamine as the sacrificial reductant) were optimized to ground or transition states using TurboMole 6.5\autocite{turbomole, ahlrichs1989}, with the TPSS meta-GGA XC functional\autocite{tao2003}. The def2-TZVP basis set was used for all atoms\autocite{schafer1994, weigend2005}. The TurboMole program contains a number of optimizations to the original \gls{ac.dft} algorithms\autocite{haase1993, treutler1995, eichkorn1997, eichkorn1995, sierka2003, deglmann2004, weigend2002, vonarnim1998, ahlrichs2004}, decreasing the calculation time without compromising accuracy. Grimme's dispersion correction (version 3) was included in the calculations\autocite{grimme2010}. Intermediates and transition states were verified by frequency analysis\autocite{deglmann2004, deglmann2002, grimme2002}, with further verification of transition states by performing dynamic reaction coordinate calculations to determine the \glspl{ac.irc}. The effects of solvation was calculated using the Conductor-like Screening Model (COSMO) implemented in TurboMole\autocite{klamt1993}, which is a continuum solvation model implicitly surrounding the solute molecule. Code was developed to assist with managing the computational jobs (see \autoref{chap.turbocontrol}).

Many of the intermediates have been synthesized in various studies \autocite{shaver1992, gibson1998, gibson1999, gibson2003}, indicating their reasonable stability. While individual portions of the mechanism have been studied computationally in the past\autocite{agarwal2011, agarwal2012a, agarwal2012b}, no overarching study has compared methods relative to each other. Furthermore, while the formation of \ce{CO} with \ce{H2O} is the most anticipated pathway (due to the lack of formation of carbonate or formate in most studies), no literature pathway exists to explain the addition of \ce{CO2} to the open site of the radical catalytic species without a three body reaction step (catalyst, \ce{CO2} and \ce{H+} together) or without formate reorganization. Furthermore, no mechanism proposed thus far explains the \ce{^{12}CO} to \ce{^{13}CO} isotopic exchange demonstrated by Lehn's group in 1986\autocite{hawecker1986}. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Eximer Formation and Decomposition of the Sacrificial Amine}\label{ss.initiation}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------

All of the pathways require the formation of a common eximer, namely, the radical 17\textit{e}\textsuperscript{-} species (\autoref{fig.eximer}). This occurs through the absorption of an incident photon with enough energy to promote an electron from the metal d-orbital to the ligand $\pi^\ast$ orbitals in the ground state catalyst, \textbf{4.01}, forming the triplet \acrlong{ac.mlct} (3-MLCT) complex \textbf{4.01\textsuperscript{3MLCT}}. This excitation requires approximately 50 kcal/mol, sourced from absorbed light. The pseudo-oxidized, electron-deficient metal atom extracts an electron from the sacrificial amine present in the reaction solution to return to the \ce{Re^{I}} state (\textbf{4.02}). However, this complex is formally a radical anion, the halide (\textbf{4.04}) is lost to return to the neutral eximer species in solution, \textbf{4.03}. This extraction to form the radical anion catalyst and the radical cation amine is thermodynamically expensive in the gas phase, costing over 80 kcal/mol, but in solution phase in \gls{ac.dmf} releasing 5 kcal.The difference in energies demonstrates the importance of performing calculations in a simulated solution; steps that may have insurmountable energy barriers in the gas phase become possible once solvation is considered.

A slight uphill to dissociation of the chloride (15.44 kcal/mol in DMF) allows for the formation of the triplet 17~\textit{e}$^-$~excimer species \textbf{4.03}, from which the  mechanism pathways discussed in following subsections may diverge. It is important to note that some studies suggest the solvent coordinates with the excimer species \autocite{morris2009, kou2014}. This solvent coordination is expected to stabilize the excimer species prior to reaction with \ce{CO2} in solution\autocite{fujita2004}. However, this event has no bearing on the overall reaction energies, the coordination and subsequent loss of solvent is an energetically neutral occurrence and was not studied in detail.

\begin{figure}[!htb]

 \end{center}
\caption{Formation of the eximer species via absorption of a photon and oxidation of the sacrificial amine.}
\label{fig.eximer}
\end{figure} 

The decomposition of the sacrificial amine was first identified by Kalyansundarem in 1978\autocite{kalyanasundaram1978}, and is summarized in \autoref{fig.decomp}. This work showed the route for decomposition of \gls{ac.teoa} but the mechanism for decomposition of \gls{ac.tea} is parallel. This decomposition is critical due to the protons it provides to the reaction mixture, and the presence of a simple second electron abstraction from the decomposition product. Upon absorption of a photon by the catalyst, the amine \textbf{4.05} is converted to the radical cationic species (\ce{Et3N^{+.}}, \textbf{4.06}). This undergoes a proton transfer to a second molecule of the sacrificial reductant. The transfer removes a proton from the $\alpha$ carbon, leaving it a neutral radical species (\textbf{4.07}). This is then able to react in the catalytic cycle to provide a second electron and form the ethene-diethylamino compound. Triethylammonia is produced as well (\textbf{4.08}), this is a proton source for the formate and water-gas shift mechanistic pathways. This step is slightly exothermic, with energy releases of 1 kcal/mol in gas phase, or nearly 3 kcal/mol in \gls{ac.dmf}.

\caption{Decomposition pathway for the sacrificial amine.}
\label{fig.decomp}
\end{figure} 

Energies of \textbf{4.01} - \textbf{4.10}, and \textbf{4.26} in gas and solution phases (in \gls{ac.dmf}) is shown in \autoref{tab.supenergy}, along with the energy of solvation. Energies of each step of the reaction are listed in \autoref{tab.suprxn}. The values show a significant `uphill' series of steps requiring significant energy input. This energy is supplied by the incident photons; this process is a photocatalyzed activation. The reaction typically requires incident light of 400 nm energy\autocite{hawecker1983}, this significant energy input allows for the pathway to be followed.

\input{tables/suprxn}

Geometries of the catalyst do not change significantly throughout this transformation, however, some changes occur signifying the change in electron localization. One metric analyzed in polyaromatic non-innocent ligand redox reactions is the bonding distance between aromatic rings \autocite{bokarev2014}. From ground state, through triplet MLCT complex to the excited radical, the C-C\textsubscript{(bpy)} distance decreases from 1.470 \r{A} to 1.425 \r{A} to 1.416 \r{A}. This 0.06 \r{A} decrease is noted in many previous experiments and calculations for anion radicals\autocite{bokarev2014, chisholm1981, castellaventura2000, gorerandall2009, irwin2010}. Other key bond lengths and angles include the ligand N-Re bonds and \ce{CO}-Re bonds, the addition and subtraction of electrons to and from the complex impact the bonding. As the reaction proceeds, for example, the calculated Re-N distance in solvated structures decreases from 2.18924 \r{A} in the ground state catalyst to 2.14212 \r{A} in the neutral radical excimer. Similarly, the distance from the metal to the axial carbonyl decreases from 1.91950 to 1.88746 \r{A} in the same circumstances. These changes are not significant, the bond order is unchanged across these distances, but bond modification of 0.05 \r{A} is large enough to demonstrate a change has occurred in the bonding around the metal. Subsequent steps in the mechanism demonstrate larger changes.

\subsection{The `Carbonate' Pathway}\label{ss.carbonate}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------

The carbonate pathway is shown in \autoref{fig.carbonate}, starting from the excimer species. This pathway has been studied in some detail in the literature, but never in a complete manner. Typical analysis consists of investigation from the formed \ce{CO2} linked dimer, through the release of \ce{CO}, terminating at the bicarbonate linked dimer. Studies typically build the dimer as a three-body reaction, or start with a \ce{Re\bond{-}Re} bound catalyst dimer and the insertion of \ce{CO2}. However, the formation of the  \ce{[L2Re(CO)3]2} is exceptionally slow in the presence of solvent, with a rate constant 8 orders of magnitude below\footnote{With the Thermodynamic Equilibrium formula $\Delta G^\circ = -RT ln(K)$, if $K \approx 10^7$, then $\Delta G^\circ \approx -40$ kJ/mol, $\approx$ -8 kcal/mol.} the solvent-stabilized radical \ce{$^\bullet$L2Re(CO)3(solv)} complex\autocite{fujita2004}.

\end{figure} 

Energies of each of the compounds involved in this mechanism pathway are shown in \autoref{tab.carbenergy}, along with the energy of solvation. The full list of reaction energies are listed in \autoref{tab.carbrxn}.

\input{tables/carbenergy}
\input{tables/carbrxn}

The mechanism begins with the addition of a \ce{CO2} molecule to the excimer, forming \textbf{4.11}. This is a very weakly bound species when solved in a simulated \gls{ac.dmf} environment; in the gas phase this transition complex will not solve. Energies for the gas phase for this compound are calculated as single point energies from the solvated structure. The \gls{ac.dmf} solved structure has a Re-C bond length of 2.50654 \r{A}, and O-C-O bonding angle of 142$^\circ$, when compared to the \ce{Re\bond{-}C} distances of rhenium carbonyls of \textit{ca}. 1.9 \r{A}, this is a very weak bond. The formation of this `bond' requires only 6.37 kcal/mol, the radical species is not satisfied with the addition of \ce{CO2} and requires further electron contribution to become more stable. This unstable complex is able to extract a hydrogen to continue with the formate pathway (see below \autoref{ss.formate}), or combine with a second molecule of the excimer to form a dimer \textbf{4.13}. This dimer formation is explicitly not favoured; although resolution of radical species is provided, the transformation via \textbf{4.12} is still \todo{numb} kcal/mol uphill in \gls{ac.dmf}. Explanation of this untenably large value may be the root of the choice in literature to utilize the Re-Re bound dimer species as the catalyst starting point, instead of the ground state. \todo{From this point onwards the reaction proceeds in achievable downhill steps, the formation of the dimer is the rate limiting step for the entire reaction pathway.} The quenching of the radical forms much stronger bonds between the metal atoms and the linking \ce{CO2}. The Re-C distance has shortened from the 2.50654 \r{A} seen in \textbf{4.11} to 2.25829 \r{A}. This is still longer than the Re-CO bonds, expected due to the lack of $\pi$ back-bonding observed with carbonyl ligands, however, it corresponds with similar published crystal structures of Re-C bond lenghts for sp\textsuperscript{2} carbons\autocite{lukehart1977}. The Re-O bond is 2.13 \r{A}, a value that remains constant for Re-O through the intermediates in the reaction pathway.

After the dimer \textbf{4.13} has been formed, a second molecule of \ce{CO2} is inserted via \textbf{4.14} to form the Re-C-O-C-O-Re complex \textbf{4.15} (see structures \textbf{4.12} - \textbf{4.17} in \autoref{fig.carbonatestruc}). This linker contains bonds from length 1.28 - 1.44 \r{A}, typical for sp\textsuperscript{2}-carbon oxygen bonds. Bond angles are typically just under the idealized 120$^\circ$ expected as well. Due to the linker, the catalyst ligand bipyridines have moved from a nearly co-planar geometry to a nearly perpendicular geometry. Re-C and Re-O bonds remain constant in length compared to \textbf{4.13}. Following the insertion of the second molecule of \ce{CO2}, internal rearrangements progress this complex through the release of a molecule of \ce{CO} and the formation of the bicarbonate byproduct. The formation of a 5 membered ring in the \textbf{4.16} transition state leads to the release of the \ce{CO} and the formation of a carbonate linked dimer, \textbf{4.17}, returning the catalyst ligands to a more co-planar orientation. The carbonate dimer species is left to decompose to a catalyst cation \textbf{4.20} with an open site, and the bicarbonate adduct \textbf{4.18}. This carbonate dianion may pick up a proton before or after the disassociation to the catalyst cationic species, resulting in the released of the bicarbonate species to solution (\textbf{4.19)} when the catalyst is returned to ground state \textbf{4.01} with addition of a chloride.

\caption{DFT calculated structures for the `carbonate' mechanistic pathway}
\label{fig.carbonatestruc}
\end{figure} 

\todo{maybe take this out?}Some work done by Agarwal \textit{et. al.} provides an opportunity for a catalytic pathway with similar results requiring only one molecule of catalyst\autocite{agarwal2012a}. Instead of capping the loosely coordinated \ce{CO2} with the eximer, the radical is quenched with a hydride extraction from the sacrificial amine, much as in the pathway described in \autoref{ss.formate}. A second molecule of \ce{CO2} reacts with the acid, undergoing a series of reorganization and dissociation/re-association steps to produce the carbonate. The experimental data supporting this variation of the mechanism is not strong; further validation should be required for this mechanism variation to gain popularity in the literature. 

%---------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The `Formate' Pathway}\label{ss.formate}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
In comparison to the catalytic dimer formed in the carbonate pathway above, the formate formation occurs via a much simpler mechanism. The addition of a proton to the open site axial to the ligand occurs via the simultaneous electron and proton transfer from a by-product of the reduction of the amine. \ce{CO2} inserts into this metal hydride bond, resulting in a metal-oxide bond, with the formate anion. Separation of the weak metal-oxygen bond allows for the reinsertion of the halide to the cationic metal centre.

\input{tables/formenergy}
\input{tables/formrxn}

After formation of the excimer \textbf{4.03}, the radical species extracts a hydrogen atom from the oxidized chain of the sacrificial amine \textbf{4.07} in transition state \textbf{4.21} \todo{fix numbering see carbonate}, a step with a barrier of 4.16 kcal/mol in the gas phase, and is favoured by nearly 10 kcal/mol in \gls{ac.dmf}. The sacrificial amine involved in this step had previously had one proton extracted by another molecule of the amine in a proton exchange step (see \autoref{ss.initiation}), resulting in a neutral radical. Extraction of the proton and electron pair allows for the formation of an ethene arm, completing the decomposition of the amine to the final neutral, singlet molecule \textbf{4.26}. Relaxation of this transition state results in the hydrogen extraction from the radical species, yielding the formation of the hydride complex \textbf{4.22}.

Some attempt was made at performing the reaction along alternative pathways. While direct $\sigma$ bonding from a metal to an oxygen atom in the \ce{CO2} molecule (as $\eta^1$-OCO) has been observed in a few systems (including photoreduction of \ce{CO2})\autocite{lee2001, mauser2001, souter1997}, this geometry is rare\autocite{castrorodriguez2004, cokoja2011, gibson1996}. Attempts to coordinate \ce{CO2} in an $\eta^1$ geometry failed to converge both in gas and solution phase, \ce{CO2} was ejected from the complex, resulting in the excimer species \textbf{4.03}. Binding of \ce{CO2} to the metal through $\pi$ coordination of the C=O bond is more common\autocite{cokoja2011, gibson1996}, but these structures failed to solve in the current \gls{ac.dft} system as well, typically via the dissociation of the \ce{CO2}.

This hydride complex is able to insert a molecule of \ce{CO2} into the metal-hydrogen bond, in transition step \textbf{4.23}. \ce{CO2} insertion to metal hydrides is commonly observed, leading mechanisms in \ce{CO2} reduction in ruthenium systems employ this addition\autocite{creutz2007}. Rhenium I hydrides are very rare, appearing only in literature in the discussion of the photocatalytic mechanism. The Re-H bond length is 1.76 \r{A}, compared to the length of the Re-Cl bond from the ground state \textbf{4.01} species of 2.51 \r{A}. This bond length difference reflects the observations on anion change from Cl to Br, the anion size is the critical factor in this variation. When a molecule of \ce{CO2} approaches, the transition state of a pseudo-septacoordinate species \textbf{4.2?} forms. The formation is expensive, at just over 14 kcal/mol. The Re-H bond increases in length to 2.16 \r{A}, the Re-O bond is 2.88 \r{A}, and the O-Re-H angle is very tight, at only 45.3 $^\circ$. This step completes with 28.66 kcal/mol energy release to form the formato anion complex \textbf{4.2?}. 

The formato anion \textbf{4.2?} contains a Re-O bond of 2.15 \r{A}, consistent with previously discussed rhenium - oxygen bonds. This formate dissociates with a chloride addition, the exchange is endothermic by less than 3 kcal/mol. This counterion switch is likely more favoured in the real solution, the presence of excess molar equivalents of an electrolyte such as tetraethylammoniumchloride ensures a surplus of chloride anions are in solution and force the conversion by entralpic means. Further reactions of the formato anion in solution are not investigated, but the anion likely remains deprotonated in the slightly basic environment.

\subsection{The `Water-Gas Shift' Pathway}\label{ss.watergas}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------
The water-gas shift mechanism involves the addition of two protons from the reductant to a \ce{CO2} molecule bound to the metal centre. The first proton addition yields an acid species, this is dehydrated via the second addition of a proton and the release of one molecule of \ce{H2O}. The resulting tetracarbonyl cationic species is able then to release an axial carbonyl to return to the ground state. While any of the carbonyl groups could be labile, the carbonyl at the axial position is the one actively replaced by the halide to return to the starting catalyst\autocite{shaver1992}.

Energies of each of the compounds involved in this mechanism pathway are shown in \autoref{tab.wgsenergy}, along with the energy of solvation.

\input{tables/wgsenergy}
\input{tables/wgsrxn}

This mechanistic pathway it thought to start by the same addition of CO2 that is seen in the carbonate mechanism (see \autoref{ss.carbonate}, forming \textbf{4.11}. \todo{check compound numbers} As before, the complex is only weakly coordinated, and requires solvation effects to solve computationally. The added \ce{CO2} is able to extract a hydrogen from the previously-reduced sacrificial amine \textbf{4.07}, allowing the completion of the ethene formation \textbf{4.26}. The newly formed acid species \textbf{4.32} dehydrates in the presence of a second proton (via \textbf{4.33}) to form water \textbf{4.37} and the tetracarbonyl cationic species \textbf{4.38}. 

Typically, this reaction had been thought to proceed on the axial site of the catalyst, mirroring the pathways discussed above. However, due to the ease of migration of the carbonyl groups, it is proposed that the `water-gas shift' mechanism does not occur entirely axial to the ligand, but begins with coordination of a \ce{CO2} molecule in between the \textit{facial}-\ce{CO} ligands, forcing a carbonyl to the axial position \textbf{4.34}. This \ce{CO2} bound in the plane of the ligand then undergoes hydrogen addition and dehydration to produce a molecule of \ce{H2O}, continuing as before. While any of the carbonyl groups could be labile, the carbonyl at the axial position is replaced by the halide to return to the starting catalyst\autocite{shaver1992}. 

This newly proposed mechanism provides a solution to a previously unexplained phenomenon. The exchange of carbonyl groups on the catalyst for \ce{^{13}CO} when using \ce{^{13}CO2} in the photoreduction is documented as early as Hawecker \textit{et al}\autocite{hawecker1986}. It was shown that complete exchange occurs with very few catalytic turnovers. Furthermore, Koike \textit{et al}. demonstrated that photochemical ligand substitution occurs at only axial sites relative to the $\alpha$-imino ligand\autocite{koike2002}, no exchange occurs at the equatorial site, nor do the \textit{fac}-\ce{(^{12}CO)2^{13}CO} reorganize to shift the \ce{^{13}CO} to the equatorial position in the timeframe of the reaction. Thus the isotopic exchange does not proceed by independent uptake of product \ce{^{13}CO}, but in fact the conversion to the \ce{^{13}CO} complex must occur via the reduction mechanism.

\subsection{Consequences From \texorpdfstring{\ce{$\kappa$^2}}{Bidentate} Terpyridine Complex Inactivity}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------

The lack of reactivity of the \ce{$\kappa$^2(terpy)Re(CO)3X} motif of complexes contrasting to the activity of the originally published \ce{$\kappa$^2(bipy)Re(CO)3X} indicates significant influence of the ligand on the mechanism. While the terdentate complex can be rationalized to be inactive due to its short-lived excited state (as seen in \autoref{chap.newchem}) \autocite{shavaleev2004}, this explanation does not suffice for the fluorescing bidentate complex. Other substituted bipyridine ligands are known to be active for photocatalytic reduction \autocite{hawecker1986, kurz2006}, identifying the most likely conflicting feature of the terpyridine ligand to be the pendant arm, and its availability for chelation to the metal centre. While in the radical eximer form, the chelation site is sterically blocked by one of the three carbonyl groups. However, reorganization of the substituent carbonyls from a \textit{facial} orientation to a \textit{meridional} could allow for the free pyridine to form the metal-ligand bond, resulting in compound (X).\todo{What is X}

\section{Comparison Between Mechanistic Pathways} \label{sec.compare}
%======================================================================

Previous studies in literature had only analyzed one of the mechanistic pathways (or a subsection thereof), without a fuller analysis of the competitiveness of each pathway relative to the others. Discussion on the tenability of each potential pathway relied on the \textit{in situ} observation of intermediates or transition states, the success (or lack thereof) of synthesis of the intermediates, and the relative production of by-products in the mechanistic trials. 

The overall energies for each of the mechanistic pathways shown in \autoref{fig.threepath} are shown in \autoref{fig.threeenergies}.

It's important to note that the energy requirements of each pathway is not the only indicator of mechanistic preference. Studies have shown the mechanism rate differs between pathways, with certain intermediates nearly blocking the progression of the redox reaction.

\section{Conclusions} 
%======================================================================

With the energies of each of the independent mechanisms elucidated, the feasibility of each mechanism becomes evident. Evidence in literature suggests that all mechanisms progress to some degree, however, the production of \ce{CO} outpaces that of the partial reduction or oxidation pathways.
