Common distinctions split most chemical compounds into one of two categories: organic and inorganic. Organic molecules contain carbon and hydrogen, with or without additional nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and the halides. Inorganic chemistry is, therefore, considered to be the remainder of the molecules possible. While they may include come aspect of organic chemistry (especially in organometallic molecules), the main structural motif or reactive center is a non-organic feature. These inorganic compounds can range from compounds such as lithium or Grignard reagents with significant organic influence, to metallic alloys or mineral compounds. With such a wide range of possibilities, inorganic chemistry has many facets. A widely active research area is the development and testing of transition metal complexes for catalytic, photo-physical, biochemical or manufacturing uses.

\section{Photochemistry \& Catalysis}
%======================================================================

A report of the first synthesized organometallic complex was published by Zeise in 1831\autocite{zeise1831}. To form what is now known as Zeise's salt, \ce{K[PtCl3(C2H4)]*H2O}, he mixed platinum chloride with ethanol, followed by a reaction with potassium chloride\autocite{hunt1984}. After some controversy to the composition of this, it was confirmed by Griess and Martius\autocite{griess1861}, and later expanded upon by Birnbaum\autocite{birnbaum1868}. 

The field of organometallics was expanded greatly by Frankland\autocite{hunt1984}, and many of his complexes were catalytically active. Further development of this new type of chemistry quickly led to useful catalysts for the conversion of petroleum products and other chemistries, using nearly all of the transition metals. These catalysts take all forms, from simple olefin and halide compounds to multi-metallic complexes with large organic ligands.

Some of the most significant organometallic catalysts since the late 1990s have been the development of earth metal pincer complexes to replace noble metal or early transition metal catalysts, which are often more toxic or expensive to produce. Brookhart and Gibson published a series of papers\autocite{small1998a, small1998b, britovsek1998, britovsek1999} on the use of iron and cobalt with bis(imino)pyridine ligands to perform ethylene polymerization at rates exceeding those of similar noble metal complexes and metallocenes\autocite{gibson2007}. The role of the ligand in the mechanism is still up for debate, but many modified systems have been synthesized and tested since the first work was published\autocite{boudier2014}.

Many of these types of pincer complexes are photochemically active. In transition metal complexes, the interaction between the metal atom(s) and the ligands can cause significant electron mobility upon the absorption of incident photons. The metal atom's \textit{d} orbitals typically lie at or near the \gls{ac.homo} energy, while the ligands often have low energy anti-bonding orbitals ($\pi^\ast$) at the \gls{ac.lumo} levels. When a photon is absorbed and is promoted from the ground state to the excited state, that state is spatially removed from the metal centre, this motion of the electron is labelled a \gls{ac.mlct}. Formally, the metal atom is oxidized by the photons, this oxidation allows for redox reactivity at the metal centre for as long as the electron remains removed to the ligand. Relaxation (through photon emission via fluorescence or phosphorescence, or via vibrational or other motion processes) can return the electron to the metal to reform the ground electronic state.

\section{Rhenium}
%======================================================================

Rhenium compounds in particular are known to have a broad range of applications. Their use in catalysis has been explored, covering olefin hydrogenation\autocite{dudle2011}, epoxidation (with chiral selectivity)\autocite{jain2008}, and in a host of organic bond formation reactions\autocite{kuninobu2011} (Friedel-Crafts acylation and alkylation\autocite{kusama1995, nishiyama2000, kuninobu2009}, nucleophilic addition\autocite{bolm2001, zhao2007}, carbon-carbon coupling\autocite{kawata2009, hori2000}, as well as other heteroatom-carbon bond formation \autocite{hua2004, adams1994, adams1996, zhao2006, muller2000}). Rhenium has also been used in radiopharmaceutical applications, due to the availability of moderately radioactive isotopes\autocite{bartholoma2009, schibli2002}. These compounds exhibit other interesting fundamental photophysical properties as well\autocite{coogan2009}. 

Since the mid-1970's, complexes containing the $\alpha$-diimine \ce{Re^I} tricarbonyl core have attracted a great deal of attention due to their attractive photochemical properties. The pseudo-octahedral \textit{fac}-\ce{[L2Re(CO)3X]} and \textit{fac}-\ce{[L2(L$'$)Re(CO)3]+} complexes have been the dominant species\autocite{giordano1979, fredericks1979, sacksteder1990, caspar1983, yam2001, feliz1998, ruiz1996, lin1992, hino1992, walters2002, striplin2001}. A large family of compounds with these formulations have been accessed by the addition of chelating diimine $\sigma$-donor ligands to \ce{[Re(CO)5X]} with the quantitative replacement of two \textit{cis} carbonyls in the \ce{Re^I} starting material\autocite{giordano1979, martin2011, abel1959, kirkham1965, zingales1967, gamelin1994, marti2005, morse1976, giordano1978}. Significantly, these reactions form only bidentate coordinated ligands with \textit{facial} tricarbonyl isomers as products even when a potentially tridentate $\sigma$-donor, such as bis(imino)pyridine or 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine. are employed in the reaction (see \autoref{fig.terdentateligands}) \autocite{granifo1999, orrell1997, abel1993, potgieter2013}. 

These robust species have been examined for potential applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)\autocite{gong1998, yu2013}, chemosensors and biotechnology probes\autocite{lo2010, lin2007, slone1995, beer1999, beer2003}, fluorescence microscopy imaging of cells\autocite{lo2010, amoroso2008, amoroso2007}, as chemotherapy agents\autocite{gimeno2014}, and the photochemical reduction of \ce{CO2} to CO\autocite{hawecker1983, hawecker1986, takeda2010, christensen1992, sullivan1985}. Among the key photophysical features of these $\alpha$-diimine \ce{Re^I} compounds is the electron transfer capability of this system and the interplay between the Re center and the well-known non-innocent redox activity of the ligands\autocite{caulton2012, lyaskovskyy2012}.

\label{fig.terdentateligands}
\end{figure}

Further development of this chemistry has been restricted by the limited structural and electronic variability of the common pseudo-octahedral \textit{fac}-\ce{[L2ReX(CO)3]} (\ce{L2} = $\alpha$-diimine) products. While these systems continue to receive considerable attention, studies detailing the coordination chemistry of the meridionally-coordinated tridentate triimine \ce{Re^I} dicarbonyl core are quite limited\autocite{jurca2013}. For example, while \ce{$\kappa$^3(terpy)Re(CO)2Cl} was initially reported in 1988\autocite{juris1988}, closer analysis of the reported analytical data (including \textsuperscript{1}H NMR) indicate that this compound is more likely \ce{$\kappa$^2LRe(CO)3Cl}. A more recent report for this compound provides spectroscopic details of this species as well as the preliminary report for the generation of \ce{[$\kappa$^3(terpy)Re(CO)2L$'$]+} cations (L = \ce{PPh3}, \ce{PEt3}, \ce{NC5H5}, and \ce{NCCH3})\autocite{black2012}. Finally, the \textsuperscript{1}H NMR data for \ce{$\kappa$^3(terpy)Re(CO)2Br} has been reported\autocite{abel1993} but accompanied no other characterization.

In order to fully exploit the potential of this versatile family of compounds, the limits imposed by the bidentate coordination need to be addressed. Furthermore, it would appear that, on the basis of the tridentate ligands that have been investigated, the concerted effort to produce the tridentate species has been essentially unsuccessful, or requiring harsh conditions\autocite{potgieter2013}. Attracted by this challenge we sought to synthesize, crystallographically authenticate, and investigate the photophysical properties of low-valent rhenium pincer complexes displaying an N,N',N''-chelated terpyridine array. 

Complexes of 2,2':6',2''-terpyridine (terpy) are of interest due to the conceptual relationship to established bis(imino)pyridine compounds\autocite{russell2010, tondreau2012}. This thesis will be a discussion of the development of chemistry of \ce{Re^I} complexes, their characterization, and comparison of structural and photo-physical properties to computed values. Further exploration of the \ce{CO2} reduction by photo-catalysis of these new complexes will be analyzed. This thesis will also take a more detailed look at specifics of the mechanisms proposed for current \ce{Re^I} diimine catalysts, and propose new geometries for prior mechanistic steps based on experimental, computational, and literature review work.

\section{\ce{CO2} Reduction Chemistry}
%======================================================================

Recent years have seen an increase in the concentration of \ce{CO2} in the atmosphere as a product of combustion of oil, gas and coal in the industry and transportation sectors\autocite{song2006}. This is of significant concern due to the greenhouse gas properties of \ce{CO2} \autocite{matthews2009, meinshausen2009}. Attempts to reduce emissions proceed by various pathways, including the utilization of renewable resources such as wind and solar for energy production\autocite{neuhoff2005}; development of more fuel and energy efficient processes; and attempts to capture \ce{CO2} from industrial exhaust streams\autocite{peratitus2014, kadantsev2013, iremonger2011}. It can then be stored in underground depositories, or used as a feedstock in the production of simple molecules or fuels\autocite{leitner1996, olah2009, kang2012}. Due to it being the final product in combustion and its high thermodynamic stability, the reduction of \ce{CO2} is an energy-intensive task\autocite{schwarz1989, morris2009}. While plant life naturally performs \ce{CO2} transformation via photosynthesis, no artificial means have proven to be robust and scalable enough for the task in large scale \autocite{arakawa2001}. 

The development of catalysts for `artificial photosynthesis' has explored various means, including utilizing metal electrodes\autocite{li2010}, electrocatalytic semiconductors (such as \ce{TiO2}, \ce{ZnS}, \ce{CdS}, or As or S doped Ag)\autocite{inoue1971, lim2014}, and organometallic species of Co, Ni, and Fe (particularly porphyrin complexes)\autocite{fisher1980, tinnemans1984, beley1986, simonmanso2004, fujita1994, fujita1993, kimura1994, dhanasekaran1999, lacy2014}. These typically require the addition of electrons, and current trends look to solar powered elecricity production for a `green' \ce{CO2} reduction platform\autocite{zeng2014}.

Alternate solutions involves the use of photoredox catalysts, including $\alpha$-imino complexes of Re\textsuperscript{I}, Ru\textsuperscript{II}, Os\textsuperscript{II}, and Ir\textsuperscript{III}  \autocite{hawecker1983, schneider2011, ishida1987, maidan1986, ishida1990, kitamura1983, tanaka2002, doherty2009, doherty2010, tamaki2013, shunsuke2013, reithmeier2014}. In recent years, the popularity of these $\alpha$-diimino compounds has increased, owing to their unique \gls{ac.mlct} excited states and easily tunable photophysical properties. Of these complexes, Re\textsuperscript{I} based catalysts are of particular interest. Whether acting as a mono-metallic photocatalyst, or with Ru in multi-metallic complexes, the high quantum yield (up to $\Phi$=0.59)\autocite{takeda2008} and exclusive selectivity to production of CO is unparalleled in these catalysts\autocite{grills2010}. Research focus has turned to tuning photophysical properties for increased use of photons in the visible spectrum (particularly lower energy) and modification of the ligand framework for increased turnover numbers and frequencies \autocite{grills2010, morris2009, kutal1985}. This thesis will focus on the synthesis and testing of a novel Re\textsuperscript{I} catalyst attempting to improve on those points.
