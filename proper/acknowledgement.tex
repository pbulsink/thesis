Thanks to the members of the Richeson and Woo research groups, both past and present, for the assistance provided and for making the time spent researching and writing this thesis enjoyable. Thanks as well to Frank and Sean in the Brusso lab, for their willingness to allow use of their characterization equipment. Thanks to Jake and the Gambarotta laboratory for use of their GC, and to the Sciano Lab, especially Janice, Charles, and Deni, for the use of their photolysis equipment. 

I'd like to thank Dr. Ilia Korobkov for his work measuring and solving the x-ray crystal structures of the compounds discussed. He assisted with some paper writing as well. 

Finally, I'd like to thank my fiance\'{e}  Leanne, and my parents for their unending support, and understanding when I came home frustrated or exhausted from work.
