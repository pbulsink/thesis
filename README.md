#Thesis LaTeX Repo#

This  is the repo in which I'm writing my thesis into. I'm writing in TeX because I think it'll be a good experience, and because I want to be able to view the history (which I can't do in a .docx file). As well, by the time I get 75-100 references going, a bunch of images, figures, tables, crossreferences, and more, word starts to struggle where TeX just powers through. 

I may or may not open this up after I finish, at least for public viewing. I'll see what happens!
