These notes attempt to provide the beginner with the correct 
\emph{approach} to using \LaTeX\ for a thesis or large document, as well as
with examples of how to format the main document structures.
The notes themselves are written in \LaTeXe\ and the source documents can
serve as a ready-made template for a thesis.
However, please also consult the UW Thesis Regulations and Guide, available
from the Graduate Studies Office, to make sure that your formatting complies 
with the current guidelines.

This is an example of a long abstract, formatted manually. 
It could be several paragraphs or even several pages long, since it may
be difficult to summarize a thesis is a few words.
Just keep track of how many pages it is and increment the counter correctly
before beginning automatically formatted pages. 
Try to keep it short though!
